1,AudioCardio: Hearing Test,iOS,USA,10/07/2022,"Results TBD, promising concept, room to improve.","I’ve been using audio cardio for about two months now due to tinnitus and also discovered I have hearing 30 years ahead of my age. It’s hard to properly compare my progress, as I used some different headphones at the beginning until I bought and settled on using AirPod Pros since they are most convenient and comfortable but still sound decent.
None the less, my tinnitus has not shown a noticeable positive change, though I will say mine maaay be caused by neck/shoulder issues that are not yet resolved or improved.

A couple notes:
Positive:
-easy to use

Areas to improve:
-there’s an allowed volume range while testing or doing therapy, which is not helpful, as you could accidentally think you made big improvements or got worse just by running at a different volume. I think the app should lock you in to *one* volume. The mimi hearing test demonstrates this well.
-it’s very hard to view progress. No graphs, yet all the data is there.
-the price seems quite steep, though I would be down to pay a higher price like it’s current price if it straight up made big improvements in my hearing

I hope to update in a few months after I’ve used it for a bit longer.",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Pricing"", ""Use cases""]"

35,AudioCardio: Hearing Test,iOS,USA,11/04/2022,Not sure what to think of this app yet,"Wonder if it is gimmicky. Been trying for it for sometime and trying to see if it makes a difference. So far haven’t seen a difference but will continue. Don’t like it that it is a paid subscription and not that cheap. 

Updated and lowered my rating since I found a few bugs with the app. Have sent those bugs to the company hopefully they can resolve it. But for the paid subscription would think it should be less or free if essentially we are beta’ing the app. 

 Update April 10, 2022. So got email from developer. App still has a few bugs and hope they can fix it soon.  Updated my review from 2 to 3 since app developers seem to really want to fix their product and are receptive to feedback.  But for price would think their main part of volume control should be fixed since this is main part of the therapy. Hopefully it works in future will try again once app is more stable with bugs fixed.  Concept and practice seems to be easy and straight forward and hopefully it can help with hearing loss and tinnitus.",negative,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Complexity"", ""Notifications & Alerts"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]"

While I use AudioCardio every day for at least an hour, I don’t really think it has improved my hearing…though perhaps it has helped me maintain where I am.  However, I do believe it has worked to calm my tinnitus significantly.  There is something about those tones that seem like maybe they stimulate something in my ear/brain that decreases the tinnitus volume. There are still some days where it is louder and more distracting and I will listen to the audio cardio more on those days – and eventually it seems to quiet things down.  I am appreciative of this app for sure as there aren’t many consistent ways to affect tinnitus.  Thank you!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Frequency"", ""Satisfied users""]"

Best practice: do the same test on each ear separately for ear bud or headphone use. Those sounds the user can hear the least are the sounds that most closely comprise their tinnitus. Put them together to cancel out the tinnitus then the user just turns this app on and they can do whatever they want while listening. Just using noise loops is lazy and ineffective.

This seems to work for me. Works well for anger issues, increasing positive attitude, and helping induce relaxation before bedtime. Placebo effect is powerful, and that could definitely be at play here. But that’s fine with me since the app is relatively cheap and I’ve got nothing to lose. 

Just please note that I DO have anxiety and I work continuously with mental health professionals to care for myself. I also exercise, eat well, and practice all self care that’s recommended.

2646,BrainWave: 35 Binaural Series™,iOS,USA,15/05/2020,Really Surprised how well it works!,"I originally got this app when I was learning to meditate and it did help me to relax and focus on what I was doing. But I didn’t really know how much of it was the app and how much of it was the meditation. However, once in a while I will get a headache that won’t go away for nothing and can last days at a time. These are bad headaches and I can’t do much of anything or think and I’m wore out after I do get rid of it. I remembered I saw there was a program on this app for headaches. I really didn’t expect it to help but I had tried everything else and I was just over it and ready to try almost anything. Even a little relief would be great. You know I started the program and the sound from the headphones was surprisingly soothing and the headache disappeared after , oh I’d say 5 minutes. Completely gone! And it didn’t come back after finishing the program either. I thought no way that had to be a coincidence. I tried it again the next time one of my headaches hit me. But same thing happened exactly. 
        I’m a retired nurse. I believe in scientific research and evidence to prove that treatments work. I can’t tell you how this works. All I can say is that it does work, and it works remarkably well. I’ve tried other programs on this app and I have to say I have not been disappointed by any of them and it blows me away each time because it’s just so easy to get relief from so many different things, even if it’s just calming the mind or wanting a good nights sleep, to getting a good grade on an upcoming test. 
      If you get headaches that are bad like mine were, or you suffer from any number of things and you are considering if one of the programs offered in this app will help you, I have to say that first of all you see your healthcare provider. But while you are doing that, I highly recommend telling them about this app, show it to them and if they say it’s safe for you to try, give it a go. If this app is half as effective for you as it was for me, you will be glad you did. I always recommend seeing your healthcare provider first for anything affecting your health, and anything you do try always do it with their knowledge and go by their recommendations. Don’t stop their treatments either unless they know. But that being said this app appears to be as safe as they get as far as a treatment for anything. I would definitely see if this is an option for anyone that could benefit from it. It works so well for me even on other programs they offer, I wish to share my secret with as many people as I can so they can benefit as well. 
    I can’t say enough good things about this app. I have not had any negative experiences with the app or the people who produce it. Thank you for giving everyone access to this technology so we can benefit from it. It seems the longer you are in business, the more options there are in programs to try. Hardest part sometimes is to decide which program I want to try today.

I love the ambient noise that comes with the app- especially ocean waves. Love that you can use itunes, but usually don’t find it necessary. I also love the slick looking super-intuitive dashboard.

The only improvement it is needs better control on fade in/fade out during programs and at the end of programs. I have the fade toggles set, and only use the app’s ambient sounds,  but they are not always working properly. The abrupt stop and start is especially jarring when you are attempting deep sleep- similar to vertigo feeling as you are just falling asleep and you jump suddenly, but without the physical jump- lol.

I’m not a specialist in this brainwave entrainment but I’m always looking to find bio-efficient ways to increase my productivity and direction. This has aided my focus in all the different goals that are present in my life and I find that brainwave entrainment helps me to cut a little sharper on every thing my energy goes towards. 
I find that it really helps when I workout, and I can also turn on Spotify or YouTube with the app running in the background. I tend to throw it on all the time it helps make me feel like I’m wading through my life, and adds a little current towards where I wanna go.

(to wake up, need to focus, realax, and to get an amazing night sleep) all I do is dial my needs, put on my headphones, and chill for the recommended time or longer. B.E. has literally changed my life! I use it for depression, addiction, meditation, headaches, tiredness, motivation, and anything that I need! I'm not the type of person who goes along with fads and products with a million claims, I'm REALLY NOT! However, B.E. makes claims that are scientifically proven over and over again. You don't even have to have to do any research to use the app, you just need a reason to use it. Put it this way, if you breath, you should practice B.E. because your entire life, outlook on life, your health, and general well being will all change for the better, and all that you have to do is...get this app!

I have used the “Deep Sleep” program and the “Headache Relief” program the most frequently. They really do work! After using the sleep program, I hd the deepest sleep that night as well as more vivid dreams than usual. The headache relief program is helpful for the occasional migraine that I sometimes get. 

The layout of the app is very natural, and the buttons are in all the right places. It’s very simple to use and has a very clean interface. The color scheme is appropriate, too. Well done!

The only complaint I have about the app is the limited selection of background music and background sound effects. While the selections are good, they have a somewhat amateurish quality to them. I feel that they could be greatly improved and expanded. 

Another thing that would be nice would be the addition of more binaural beats — if possible — for different things or for things of a very specific, direct nature.

I have had this app for 2 years and I can definitely say that the deep sleep module will put me fast to sleep. I also use the focus/concentration mod while working and can easily get into a zone and get all of my tasks done. This app is a must have for any life or bio hackers!",positive,[]

L’éditeur a répondu à mon message (cf. ci-dessous) et m’a présenté ses excuses. Ils ont corrigé le bug que je leur ai signalé et qui pouvait effectivement produire dans certains cas un bruit violent. 

Dommage pour moi… mais au moins ma mésaventure a été prise en compte et cela évitera à d’autres utilisateurs.trices de subir le même sort. 

Je remonte donc ma note à 4 car malgré ce qui m’est arrivé, je pense que l’application peut apporter une aide. Je crois que cela commençait à diminuer la nuisance de mon acouphène initial avant que le bug n’en rajoute une couche… 

———

Dimanche soir dernier (21 novembre 2021), en ouvrant l’un des modules de Diapason, en passant l’un des nombreux écrans intermédiaires (qui sont d’ailleurs inutiles après des centaines d’utilisations), il s’est produit un bruit très aigu et d’une intensité si forte qu’il m’a fait sursauter (j’étais dans ma chambre, dans le calme et le silence, je ne m’attendais pas à être agressé par un son violent, et c’est pourquoi je pense mes tympans ont été si impactés). J’utilise Diapason depuis le mois d’avril, et ce genre de bruit imprévu s’est déjà produit à plusieurs reprises, mais avec des intensités beaucoup moins fortes. Heureusement que je me méfie des écouteurs et que je n’en utilise pas. Si j’en avais eu ce soir-là quand ce bruit est survenu, cela aurait été catastrophique pour mes tympans. En me couchant, je n’ai pas réussi à m’endormir tout de suite comme d’habitude car ce son violent a aggravé mon acouphène, alors que précédemment, mon acouphène ne me gênait pas pour m’endormir. Après un long moment je me suis finalement endormi, mais ce problème pour s’endormir s’est également produit lors de mes réveils nocturnes. J’espérais que la situation reviendrait à son état antérieur, mais malheureusement, j’ai constaté au cours des jours suivants que l’intensité de mon acouphène avait bel et bien augmenté. Je suis révolté, outré, qu’un programme comme Diapason, dont la raison d’être est d’aider les gens atteints d’acouphènes, ne soit pas testé de façon plus professionnelle et qu’un dysfonctionnement de cette importance puisse survenir. Fin avril, afin de tenter d’apporter une solution à mon acouphène, j’ai fait confiance à cette application, j’ai payé l’abonnement (obligatoirement annuel) qui représente tout de même une certaine somme, puis j’ai chaque jour fait les exercices recommandés, avec assiduité et persévérance. Jusqu’au bruit de dimanche soir, qui a provoqué un nouveau traumatisme auditif pour moi. J’ai le sentiment d’avoir été trahi, poignardé par quelqu’un à qui je faisais confiance. J’ai signalé par écrit ce qui m’est arrivé aux développeurs à deux reprises mais je n’ai reçu aucune réponse de leur part. Pourtant, fin avril, quand j’hésitais à m’abonner à l’application et que je les ai contactés pour avoir des précisions, ils m’ont répondu très rapidement pour me convaincre… Maintenant, je ne vais évidemment plus me servir de l’appli, mais comme l’abonnement est annuel, j’en suis pour mes frais, en plus de mon acouphène aggravé ! Je poste cet avis sur l’Apple Store afin d’éviter à d’autres personnes, je l’espère, de tomber dans le piège d’un remède pire que le mal.

There is therapy to reduce the ringing; cognitive therapy to help the sufferer adjust to their “new normal”; education, to help you better understand what is going on in your ears and brain; and clever little games, to help you train your brain to focus on the sounds that you DO want to hear, rather than the ringing or buzzing.  This app is expensive, but it's worth it.  It’s helped me to calm down my tinnitus!",positive,[]

J’ai téléchargé cette application étant en quêtes comme beaucoup d’autres personnes d’une solution pour soulager mes acouphènes. Je teste actuellement le bruit sur mesure conçu d’après les spécificités de mon acouphène après calibration et cela fonctionne pour moi à quasiment 100% pour quelques instants. J’ignore a cet instant si cela peut fonctionner sur plus longtemps. A ce que j’ai pu lire dans les commentaires, il ne s’agit pas là d’un quelconque bruit blanc qu’on pourrait trouver sur internet. J’ai testé des tas de vidéos de bruit blanc, rose etc, et aucun n’a fonctionné comme celui ci.

The package with all of the features you can have it on Continuous play or any duration. You can also make it sound like it is oscillating. You can also change the app background color for FREE!

Last night we had a wind storm, and I lost power. My fan cut out at 3:30 in the morning leaving me in that weird silence where I can hear my own heartbeat. I really cannot stand that. I have an active mind, and just need... something. Anyway, I was desperate to fill my quiet room, and so I searched “fan sound” in the App Store. I downloaded the first one I saw, which wasn’t you. The sound was too artificial and high-pitched. It sounded like one of those little, high-velocity, metal fans? Eh. Just wasn’t doing it for me. So I went back. scrolled, and found this. It’s perfect. It sounds like a good box fan. I put my volume up, and placed my phone on the other side of my room in the darkness. Sounds so authentic! Nice and low, with all of those subtle little mechanical noises that are always sort of ‘there’ but not there? Anyway, I was so grateful for this app. So grateful. I fell back to sleep pretty much right away. Thanks so much for your app. Seems like such a simple thing, but it’s that simplicity that we count on the most. Sleep! Basic need.

3525,"GG OCD - Anxiety, Mood & Sleep",iOS,USA,07/02/2022,Can help distract your thoughts.,"OCD is a *****. I needed to try something. Maybe I shouldn’t have turned into a phone app for this, but for someone like me, it’s hard to open up to people about it. So I gave it a shot, it charged me 80 bucks, so I figure I had to try it then. When my mind is racing, sometimes I turn to this app to help slow it down or distract it. I can definitely help in that regard. It basically works through affirmations, which can seem a little cheesy at times and not directed towards you, but every once in a while something will pop up that sticks with your mind. 

However here is a note to the app designers. Some types of OCD can feel like a runaway train and you find yourself in situations where you need help in that very moment.If I am turning to your app for that help, I don’t care about reviewing your app at that point. When I am prompted to review your app, I quickly discard it to get to the heart of your app. Once I discard the prompt to review, then you throw me into a questionnaire about how I think your app is doing. Ask me that stuff after the session. Especially since it’s a paid service. I think your intentions are great, and I don’t think it would be easy to see how frustrating this is without actually experiencing it in a moment of compulsiveness. It comes across as very disingenuous. Again, just put it at the end of the session and I think it’s a problem solved.",neutral,"[""Bugs"", ""Complexity"", ""Gaming"", ""Payment"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]"

I use it every day and only takes a few minutes 

Pro Tip - Really read and digest the text boxes before either accepting (down swipe) or rejecting (up swipe)

Two complaints 

1. English phrasing can be poor at times   I’m sure this is being translated and it can be a little frustrating  (please fix - seems lazy)

2. Random app crashes at the end of an exercise. ( Didn’t happen until later into the course) 

Other than those I highly recommend    I’ll give it 5 stars instead of 4 when it’s improved a little     Definitely worth it

However. I did not find a big difference between my test with and without my hearing aids in place. I used over the ear headphones so I think I should have seen the graph as being much flatter with the aids in as with them out but that was not the case. 

Also, the age test said my ears were 75 years old regardless of what I indicated I could hear. I actually heard nothing :(. 

I donated anyway because the profile shape was so close to a full proper test at the clinic.",mixed,"[""Audio"", ""Satisfied users""]"

3660,Hearing Test & Ear Age Test,iOS,Sweden,13/10/2020,Leta vidare—denna är inte bra,"Trots en massa reklam, banala och konstigt formade knappar, dåligt språk i användargränssnittet, menyer och inställningar, så kan jag inte klaga. 

Appen är gratis med en massa Google-reklam. Innan jag köper någonting (35:-) för att ta bort reklam, väljer jag att först prova testet. 

Jag blir omedelbart tveksam till om appen går att lita på — instruktionerna lyder: 1) “Gå till väldigt tyst miljö” [sic] 2) Anslut hörlurar eller öronsnäckor och använd dem korrekt 3) Sätt volymen på 50%?.?.?.? 

Här blir jag skeptisk. 50% med mina AirPods Pro, ett par over-ear-lurar eller ett par vanliga hörlurar för 69 kr från Kjell & Co kommer alla att producera tre helt olika ljudvolymer, i dB mätt. Framförallt, kommer riktigt låga frekvenser höras bättre i en eller två av dessa hörlurar medan höga frekvenser inte kan genereras av de billigare lurarna…

Testet måste vara utformat efter en viss ljudutrustning, och det måste ta hänsyn till vilken hårdvara lyssnaren använder! 

?? Hade testet varit kalibrerat efter EarPods, AirPods, AP Pro och några omtyckta Sony-lurar så hade utvecklaren bara behövt kalibrera testet utefter några få olika hörlurar. Du som lyssnare väljer bara vilka hörlurar du har, innan du startar testet.  

?? Jag hade aldrig initat på denna app. För att få ett audiogram som representerar min hörsel på ett någorlunda detaljerat vis, se Mimi Hearing Test istället. Denna är gratis, dessutom utan reklam och IAP.  Din data och integritet förblir till och med intakt (företaget tjänar pengar på andra ljudprodukter).

?? Audiogram kan förresten skrivas till Hälsa-appen — och Hälsa kan sedan läsa av det för att utvärdera din hörsel. Bättre än så blir det i iOS 14 om du äger ett par AirPods Pro… 

Under Inställningar > Hjälpmedel > AirPods kan du snabbt ställa in anpassat ljud utefter ditt audiogram från Mimi Hearing Test. Förändringarna i ljud och frekvenser kan appliceras på medier (musik, videor, etc.), på telefonsamtal, transparensläget — eller alla tre.

3746,Infinite Storm: Rain Sounds,iOS,Thailand,28/12/2020,Here are what I think could be improved,"Updated review: I’m still confused because of the UI. I suggest making it clear where to download more sounds, and where the downloaded sounds go. 

Putting tab view inside a sheet is weird. It makes navigating the app harder than necessary. 

The sleep timer still looks like a blog from 2004 that the owner thinks having gif as a background will make the homepage look more fancy. It could look better, especially the buttons. 

The catalogue has various types of sound, but the niche ones only have one sound/preset. I’d be very happy if there are more.

The image on the first screen, I don’t know why it’s there. It serves very little purpose, in my opinion. 

Lastly, I like the price. Very affordable. I’m very likely to keep using the premium plan, but I’d only recommend this app when it has better UI.",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Camera & Photos"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Pricing"", ""Use cases""]"

I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an ambient sound app; I have premium and it is definitely worth it.

For the developers, there are a few improvements that could be made. Some of the backgrounds are glitchy when the screen is rotated or otherwise interacted with, which needs fixing. It would also be helpful if, like in the section to download new presets, there was a list of all presets that could be sorted by type. Sometimes I have trouble finding the ones I want. Additionally, a way to edit existing custom presets would be immensely helpful.

3899,Infinite Storm: Rain Sounds,iOS,Australia,04/10/2019,Version 7.11: great app + how to make it better,"Note: This review is based on the free version.

PROS:
Plenty of options about the type of rain to listen to. Plus other sounds like white noise and urban sounds.

The control centre is excellent, especially the “Recently Played” feature.

I like the free “Featured Sounds” that can be downloaded to the “My Sounds” tab.

The developer responds to reviews with info about what could be in a new version.

Regular updates to squash bugs and improve the app (e.g. restoring the app’s ability to change orientation, fixing the Fade Out Timer bug) - so many improvements in version 7.00 that I increased my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.

HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER:
Add the option of an all-black background picture so that the iPad won’t emit any light while the app is on.

Add the ability to tap on the background picture to toggle the control panel, instead of having to swipe the control panel down or tap on a small icon.

Space out the buttons and increase their size so that it’s not so easy to tap the wrong button.

Add the option to download the “Classic Presets” so that they’re on the “My Sounds” tab.

In the “My Sounds” tab, tapping the three-dot-icon gives us only one option: deleting the sound. In that case, change it to a trashcan-icon.

The Fade Out Timer is awful - instead of only setting the finish time, it should also offer big buttons with lengths of time - 1 hour, 10 minutes, 1 minute - so that the timer can be set quickly and easily.

Add the ability to set sound-pictures as our favourites so that they show up near the top of the screen.

Add the ability to save the current settings, so that we don’t have to adjust them every time.

CONCLUSION:
The most-improved app that I’ve used in 2019. A great app, with a little room for improvement. If you liked this review, please long-press it and mark it as “helpful.”",mixed,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Camera & Photos"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Gaming"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases"", ""Devices""]"

3951,"myNoise | Relax, Sleep, Work",iOS,New Zealand,31/03/2022,Painting with Sound,"There is so much to love about this fantastic app. Even though I’ve had it as an essential app on my phone for many years, I’m always finding new and creative ways to use it in my daily life. I also have tinnitus and on days where it gets really intense, this app is amazing at helping me re-focus and recalibrate. 

I love the comprehensive, high quality sounds and highly recommend purchasing them all. The more I explore, the more I find to create with. It feels like I have access to an enormous blank canvas of potential, on which I can freely paint with sound, like an artist uses colour. Each sound has multiple, dynamic layers, and once you add the ability to layer different sounds on top of each other, the possibilities truly are endless. 

What I am most grateful for, above all, is that this app is so accessible. I am blind and use VoiceOver on my phone. Sound is crucial to me, and many similar apps I’ve tried either have low quality sounds, and/or are not accessible. This is hands down the most accessible app of its kind that I’ve found, working perfectly with VoiceOver. Highly recommended for other blind users. 

In other words, if you, too, want to paint with sound, grab this app, select a sound and start creating!

At night I constantly thought of death and my body would start fearing sleep and flinch every time I felt my conscious slipping. I was a little insomniac because I kept feeling this terror that I couldn’t control as it got worse and worse each night. 

I simply would not calm down and sometimes suffered panic attacks. This app is really helping me ease out of this nightmare, I purchased the app sound pack and I am truly happy with that decision.

I love the rpg library the sound of writing, and the clock was somehow really relaxing for me and the Japanese garden with the wind chimes and birds. I think this app is really great. I know many would use this for just white noise but it’s really helping me to finally sleep… when before all I felt at night was  terror. 

The sounds distract my head and make it hard to focus on negative thoughts at night, and instead I can focus on the sounds it creates rather than my heartbeat (which used to trigger my thoughts of death).

There is definitely room for experiments!

The price is very reasonable, especially considering that the app starts out free with several tracks already to choose from, then you can buy the rest of the tracks individually for 99 cents each, or buy all 100+ and any new sounds that are released for 10 dollars, which is very worth the money.

I seen other reviews that were complaining about the price, but I don’t see why it’s such a bank breaker, the developers traveled the world to collect these sounds to share with us, I think that their efforts and passion should be well worth over the small amount they ask for all their present, and future sounds.

4062,"myNoise | Relax, Sleep, Work",iOS,USA,20/08/2021,It’s perfect for writing and drawing!,"This is exactly what I’ve been turning the AppStore upside down to find!

I haven’t found another app that’s had so many sounds, and I love the RPG elements, especially the battlefield ambiance, I have used sound ambiance apps like this before to sleep, but their main use for me is farther immersing myself in the worlds that I create in my head, and this app had expanded my arsenal of ambiance for any of my (many) moods, especially for drawing.
The fireworks are beautiful and I’m at awe at the quality of these sounds, and each set of sounds has an amazing description from the creator, I can sense this is more then just a means of profit to them, they take the time to record these sounds and from the description alone it’s obvious they enjoy what they do.

You’ve definitely acquired a fan with me haha, I also have a few ideas for new RPG sounds:

(I’m into fantasy rpgs and ambiance, as well as sci fi)

Bustling fantasy tavern: the sounds of hearty laughter, the clanking of mugs and the sweet melodies of a homesick bard, I would absolutely listen to it all day lol!

The marching of an army to war: the sound of heavy footfalls in unison, perhaps to the beating of a war drum, the howling winds of a storm brewing, and the clanking of the soldiers armor, (perhaps the sounds of flags/banners bellowing in said winds)

Traveling horseback: Hearing the sound of your steeds hooves crunching over gravely paths or the clump of their impact upon the earth as you travel across new lands, perhaps crossing through a stream. hearing the steady breathing of such a large animal seems oddly calming, it might be a good track to couple with other ambiance’s like winds and forest sounds.

For sci fi I would love to hear a track more oriented to a space station, the sounds of a busy starship docks like air locks opening and closing, squeaky boots on the hard floors, loading and unloading ships, like heavy things being sat down hard, a distant intercom.

I’m sure I can come up with at least a dozen ideas, but these are on the top of my list of ambiance I’d love to hear, I’m not sure how you make these sounds, but I’m sure it’s hard work, and please don’t think I’m one of those demanding reviewers that will constantly check the updates to “make sure” these ideas will come to reality, I’m not doing that at all, it’s just fun to pass along ideas, and it was fun coming up with these ideas to share!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]"

I tried all kinds of earbuds, but none of these can block the barking.

Last week I discovered your app and now I have had several good nights. I use the white noise combined with rain sound, on 50% volume on my iPad. It's on a table about 1,5 meters from my head.

What a relief, to wake up from myself instead of from brutal barking noise. Tension has been replaced by relaxation.

4086,"myNoise | Relax, Sleep, Work",iOS,USA,02/07/2021,"Developed well, and has a long history","TL;DR
Been using this app in one way or another for many years. This app has been my goto for years.. by a longshot - for binaural beats, then isotonic beats. It’s other modes are also impressive... its easy to use and it works.

One of my many forays during my prepubescent to pubescent years of around 96’-02’ I was very interested in becoming much more of an efficient individual. I discovered binaural beats. I found a simple windows program that required me to actually do work of calculating the left ear hertz and right ear hertz to entrain my own brainwaves to become more wakeful, or quickly fall asleep, or even relax. Life’s complexities and difficulties left me *somewhat* forgetting binaural beats.

 It became super apparent that Javascript/ESscript was the future, so periodically I’d search up a “web-based binaural beats”. Each time I’d peruse the results I’d come across myNoise (or its precursor) for at least 5+ years now. Out of all the results and knowing what else was out there this was by far the best around - for many of years now. Especially regarding Binaural to Isotonic beats? This app is truly the best out of the ones I’ve found. Doesn’t require you to add together the hertz of L and R ears. Just click a preset; or adjust some bars to get to the desired brainwave profile.

Also, for me? It works.. each time. Each and every time I think pffffsshh this sound ??.. its ridiculous .. how will this put me to sleep!?
Then I suddenly wake up refreshed. It does its job every time as long as you let it.

The most important part to me is the developer clearly cares about their work.. which is seemingly becoming less and less of a virtue these days.

Especially in sort of independent applications.

5 stars for having the MyNoise developer making the most dependable and best app.. being there for me for many many years every time I’d periodically search it up. 
Also 5 stars for the reviews published on the website.. hilarious and makes it obvious to me this is not “big dev” or whatnot.
Thanks ?? for developing this little miracle app/platform. 
?? also thanks to those who submitted various other audio templates... so many great sounds.

In conclusion? 5 ?? as it does the job and it does the job + it does the job quite well.",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]"

The next day I sampled some of the non-free tracks, and took a chance on the “All you can hear” option. Currently, the “Distant thunder” track is my favorite for sleeping, but others I’ve tried have been great too. I often play one of the tonal tracks in the evening to relax. I’ve mostly used the default options, but the customization, and mix options are unbelievable.

Oh great sound wizards I have a request. Please do a few different cricket concertos.  All of the cricket soundscapes have either an annoying harsh foreground with beautiful backdrops or annoying chittering backdrops to a few soothing crickets.  Your magic world would be amazing with some gentle rhythm soothing cricket sounds that aren’t too harsh and cutting in the foreground. With slower rhythms. And then magical backgrounds that are more ambient. AND bonus extra wizard points for Frog Choirs.

When I want to relax I use Unreal Ocean, putting only the highest tones up. It has made my life so much lighter. I really like it that the basic version is free and not messed up by advertisements.

The mynoise website and app were a godsend when working in a noisy office, and now great for blocking out neighbors while WFH. I find the “Audio Jammer” noise really useful and more efficient than regular white noise at blocking things out (can be at lower volume).

Simply put, there are too many expensive and subscription-based apps out there that seem to do far less than this one, and the developers have my total respect and loyalty for how they approached myNoise. Not only with updates to their beautifully curated library of sounds, but bonus points for the “animation” feature within each soundscape, which brings a layer of randomness and “replay value” to each experience.

I’m not entirely sure but I don’t think all of the generators from the website are on the app? 

It would be great if we could mute each gen individually when doing multi gens as to better hear each part when creating a new sound.

Also really wish we could sort the list of our downloaded and favorite gens alphabetical or something. Right now they just seem random and I have to scroll up and down a couple times before finding what I’m looking for.

A choice of themed noise generators (color, ocean, rain, etc) each with its own EQ controls (I always prefer the lowest-pitched noises).

The ability to save custom settings for each generator.

The ability to mix different generators, which is awesome.

I use this app in tandem with my noise canceling headphones to help block some of the higher frequency sounds; as current solutions on the market are not capable of doing so on their own. I used to rely on music, but the repetition and bombastic nature of even the simplest classical pieces makes the experience tiresome after some time. The audio layerings is superb, the customization has just the right amount of depth, the sound quality is some if the best around, and the added ability to use this in tandem with other audio applications helps to mix things up, preventing potential monotony which allows for hours of painless listening.

If I had any complaints, is that some of their noises are not as flesh out as others. For example, they have a ‘warp speed’ theme, which simulates being on your favorite ‘non copy righted’ sci-fi series. Unfortunately the samples for their loops have a ton of repetition. You can get away with this for wind or rain as they don’t produce distinct sounds. Not so much when you have a series of ‘beeps’ and ‘boops’ that produce very specific notes an octaves; would love if they could slice the samples, introduce dynamic pitch variations and toss in a randomized seed pattern to help minimize this effect (but I’m sure they probably encountered issues with quality and consistency at that point).

But I have to for this one. As someone who has struggled with insomnia my whole life, I’ve tried a lot of different soundscapes, but there was always something I didn’t like mixed in them. Always. I have dreamed of something like this for years where I could filter out any part of the noise I didn’t want, or choose just a portion, etc. This app is all this and more. The sound quality is clear and amazing, I love true adjustments and being able to combine the soundscapes the way I want them- I truly don’t know what more could be hoped for! And- what a bargain for this app- you get sooooo many incredible options. I was truly blown away, and I have never been able to fall asleep as peacefully as this allows me to (most nights.)

4339,"myNoise | Relax, Sleep, Work",iOS,USA,11/07/2020,Get the all-you-can-hear for the best White Noise app around.,"So, honestly, if you need a FREE white noise app, there are better ones. However, a couple of dollars turns this into far and away the best background noise app in the store. It is more powerful and more customizable than others and the sounds are of higher quality. You will never hear the loop... it might not even exist in the way it does in other apps. The sliders and mixer features provide a inconceivable number of changeable background noises and environments. Some other apps may appear to have more sound options, but because of the precise way MyNoise works, the possibilities are truly limitless. Using the sliders, each sound provides a nearly infinite number of listening choices and venturing into the generator to make custom mixes opens up literally endless soundscapes. 

I love MyNoise so much that I have the app and am a continual supporter of the website. I have tried them all. Every so often I will find other generators with a specific recording or two I quite like. Overall, though, this is easily the best.

I'd urge anyone who likes this app to check out the web version and donate as it is very comprehensive. (Donating gives you full access).
The only niggle I have, and its a very small one.. is that the binaural beats samples are not true binaural tones. A true binaural tone generator plays two (clean) tones seperately, one in each ear and the 'beat'  effect is generated by your own hearing registering the slight difference in their frequencies as a slow 'beat' or low frequency tone. The samples on here seem to have no seperation, i.e. you can hear the beat in either ear.  You should hear just a clean tone and no beat if you listen to just one side, and not the beat, which only should appear when you are hearing both tones.

4426,"myNoise | Relax, Sleep, Work",iOS,USA,05/04/2020,In or out?,"Edit: to clarify some of the below, I also use Android and this app is a dumpster fire over there. iOS is better, but has a long way to go. 

Like the website a lot but let’s be honest, society doesn’t want to use a browser for anything on a phone. People demand an app to tell them to drink water, etc. it’s ridiculous but happens to be reality. 

This app is lacking and I understand why. Apps are very difficult. They break when the website is changed and the app isn’t instantly updated. Apps present a significant challenge in mimicking website features, particularly with a site like myNoise (publicly shared eq configurations, all of it). I agree with the myNoise owner who basically says don’t buy the app and just use the website. 

The aggravation is the app is costly and no doubt costs a fortune to maintain and build upon., but remains for sale. Then the developer puts some snark in the new release notes saying “apparently people want to use the app?” indicating their resentment for bad reviews or people wanting feature parity with the website. 

My armchair consumer opinion is to just shelve the app and don’t bother OR aggressively produce a product that addresses paying customer’s requests without eye rolls. 

Regardless, I use the app and it’s good enough, but end up using the website most of the time anyhow. If it was a superb app, I’d pay monthly, which I absolutely detest (revenue drips) or pay double what it is now.

But it blew away my expectations and offers more than I could have thought of on my own. Usability and customization is excellent. Variety and range of options incredible. The passion, experimentation, diverse tastes, and creativity of the app’s creator and his love of sound and audio comes through strongly.

I increasingly explored new things and found both familiar and obscure chants, numerous variations on things like waves, rain, and running water with subtle but tangible differences I never would have thought I would care about, and a wealth of both natural and electronic / synthetic noises and soundscapes than I use when napping, meditating, or even sleeping that have a magical ability to tune out internal thoughts and self-dialogue, reset by brainwaves, and restore my focus and energy.

While on pain meds and recovering from surgery with my leg immobilized, listening with earbuds dramatically improved my ability to focus away from the discomfort and sleep at night.

Excellent sound choices, including a nice “cafe” which is great for blocking voices in a noisy office.

A couple issues. First off, the equalizer has a control where I use a two-finger drag to change all sliders together.  Unfortunately this only works in one direction... up. Once I’ve gone up I can’t get it to go down again, except by switching to a different sound, then back to the one I’m working on.

The second issue is that the sound catalog isn’t well organized. It’s not easy to find things. The search is okay, but overall I mainly find new things on the web site, or simply by scrolling and seeing what I find randomly.

When I get overstimulated or anxious my rain preset calms me like nothing else. It brings me back to center. When I have trouble sleeping, I listen to the same preset and it calms my brain enough to turn off. 

I like that I was able to take the rain noise and tweak it. Their preset scenes were a great starting point. So I started “on the porch,” dropped the treble a bit to reduce stimulation and increased the bass to add more calm. It’s perfectly tailored to the needs of my ears and brain.

BUT [adding some caveats to my previous super positive review:
1. I started playing the noise through my studio monitors to try to get a nice full range and block out sound more comfortably. Turns out the audio quality of the white noise at least is pretty low. I realize white noise itself is artifact-y but the way you can tell is that the high end kind of hurts to listen to. It does not sound smooth like other white noise hi end I’ve heard. Maybe that particular setting isnt designed that way?

2. No pink noise gens! 

But. On with praising the design:

the first thing I see is the first stuff I’d want to be able to do, then if I look closer I find out I can save the setting I just made, then if I look even closer I find out I can *mix* *multiple* soundscapes which I can separately modify. 

The visuals are cool but not distracting and are appropriate to their functions. On & on. I work in live audio so I love that this lets me personalize my noise! Has a nice number of bands (but I think the right amount to not confuse average user), and the ranges w/in each work pretty well for my needs. It’s the super cheap version of noise canceling headphones. Has saved my sleep and study life so many times already and I’ve only had it a few weeks!

Most other apps have rain samples that are too weak, overly harsh, or have bad noticeable loops or even extra sounds like people or vehicles. 
You do have to pay for some of the sounds, but it’s only a few dollars and you’re not going to need dozens of them. 

There are many other samples available which also seem good, but I haven’t tried many. To my surprise there isn’t a satisfying waves on the beach available, only extremely gentle ones.

The app itself is pretty good, if a bit quirky. Even now I’m used to it I don’t find it very intuitive.

[Original review:] 

I have sensory processing issues and use MyNoise (the app and the website) almost perpetually to help me focus, calm down, or get into the mode to write a certain scene (I'm also a writer). I purchased the all-inclusive generator pack sometime last year and I think it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. 100% worth it. I also appreciate that there's a Tip Jar option, as I love MyNoise and want to be able to support it but can't always afford to drop the minimum $5 on the website ($0.99 at a time or purchasing the occasional track on iTunes is way more within my reach at this stage in my life, as I have a chronic illness and am essentially unemployed).

[Edit] Oh, two things have long bothered me, though. #1: If I'm looking for a generator to add to a multi-generator that's currently playing and I sort the list by category, then select an item, it wipes the multi-generator and just plays that one. I don't have this problem when I use the search feature to filter -- just when I apply a category filter. #2: I really wish there was a way to sort my generators alphabetically or something so that I didn't have to depend on my memory of either where a filter is listed or how old it is to find it in the list.

This app plays the beat in both ears so the brain is not required to interpret anything. It’s like going to the gym and letting your personal trainer lift the weights for you.

I have sensory processing issues and use MyNoise (the app and the website) almost perpetually to help me focus, calm down, or get into the mode to write a certain scene (I'm also a writer).

Other than that I really love all the features on this app! The sliders are great (though not as advanced as they are on a browser, I noticed), and the fact you can combine sounds (which I wasn’t expecting) is so great, as well as the fact that you can set a timer so it’s not running all night draining your battery!

There are even soundscapes for tabletop and card gamers, destination soundscapes, and more neutral things like tones and white noise!

Also! There are 10 sliders per soundscape. Hate that one noise in the background? Turn it completely off without affecting the other sounds!

The recordings are quite long. You don't hear the same bird song for a long time, and if you turn on ""animate"" you most likely won't notice the repeat. Because animate changes the volume of all sliders randomly, making all 10 sounds at different noise levels all the time.

If you quit the app (by swiping it up), return to it, and then go to the favorites section where all of your custom and multigen sounds are found, they will have disappeared. I figured a workaround was merely to keep the app open in the background at all times. However, today I discovered that the app had frozen and rebooted automatically.

Close the app and reopen the next night and all the animate settings have gone!

4 stars for the app though, because I have a gripe with saving multi-gens, I wish that saving a multi-gen would save the sliders for all generators involved, instead of saving the active presets.

I downloaded a few apps, and this one was the absolute winner. I found out that I could stop the ringing if I play a high frequency tone (somewhere between 10 and 11 kHz) and hold it close to my ear. I need to move my phone around a bit to find the right position where I don’t hear the tone from the app or the ringing in my ear. It’s amazing; experts say it is impossible to use anti-noise, because tinnitus isn’t a real sound, but this absolutely works for me.

5186,Noisli,iOS,USA,27/02/2020,Amazing app yet this app needs app blocker,"I am impressed how simple this app to use. Not like other applications this is far more simpler to use, you do not need an account to sign up, all you need is to pay for the app which is not  too expensive. I’m not big fan of subscriptions because other developers is making others pay per month. Why not per year? 
People has to continue working to make money. 

Also as for your extension, I was kind of feeling disappointed because you’re doing subscriptions too, as long you are not demanding for money. For the rational reason I think your doing this to keep your applications from having any problems, especially from us customers using your app. 

As customer of these applications, instead of pressuring the developers to push themselves to work hard. Work smart than hard because it will be difficult to tackle onto difficult tasks, although I suggest breaking down the difficult tasks into steps to complete a harder task to improve this application. 

One more thing before I go. Do you mind adding an app blocker to keep myself and others from being distracted? Since social media, and the internet is source of my distractions I’m mostly on my iPad than my laptop. I think it would be smart if you add an app blocker, since I already paid for this when I got the app. Could you add the app blocker for people who already paid for the app?",mixed,[]

While the number of bad days has certainly reduced, I still have days when I can’t focus on anything but the constant noise inside my head. While I’ve only been using the app for a short time, I can tell that the tools they provide will help speed the process of my brain’s adjustment. The breath work has already helped me control the anxiety the ringing causes. The therapy sessions are short, so they aren’t overly intrusive and I can squeeze them into my day easily. The way the background noise is tuned to your tinnitus specifically is amazing- I’ve also used the in app to show others in my life exactly what my tinnitus sounds like, which helps me feel less isolated in dealing with this.

5356,Oto: Tinnitus,iOS,USA,10/09/2021,Extremely helpful,"I found this app while in a stage of such severe tinnitus that I was experiencing a panic attack. Only those who are living with tinnitus can appreciate what that kind of experience is like. Between the therapy sessions, the masking sounds, and personal correspondence with members of the staff via email, I gained control, and brought my tinnitus to a manageable level, within a couple of days. Working this program is keeping it there.
This program teaches that it is anxiety that increases the symptoms of tinnitus to unbearable levels. Working this program, training your brain to utilize the tools learned here in therapy sessions to become second nature, automatic habits and responses, combats the anxiety, and brings tinnitus down to, and keeps it at, a manageable level.
After years of living with this condition, this is the first truly effective means of consistently controlling my tinnitus I have found.
Definitely five stars.",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Notifications & Alerts"", ""Satisfied users""]"
5357,Oto: Tinnitus,iOS,United Kingdom,10/05/2021,My tinnitus doesn’t bother me at all anymore,"Just wanted to leave a review as I have had an extremely positive experience from using the tools available this app. I am a musician and had sudden onset of tinnitus about 8 months ago after a practice session. I tried a few different things but the only one that has reduced the loudness is by undergoing CBT and breathing exercises through this app. I couldn’t go to my parents house as it was too quiet and so my tinnitus would be uncomfortably loud. Now I can happily say I can go and spend time there and the tinnitus doesn’t bother me. I forget I have it now most of the time. Obviously the journey is different for everyone but I have most definitely seen an improvement. 

Benefits of the platform:

If you have any questions there is a chat function and someone will get back to you really quickly which I found very helpful during a spike period and I first downloaded the app
There are loads of different exercises and types of exercise so I pick and choose what I feel like doing that day. The variety is great. Unlike some other meditation apps this tries to treat tinnitus through a number of different angles
The sessions aren’t too long so I like to fit in a couple short ones a day which is helpful if you’re busy! About 5-8 minutes.
Lili, who guides you through the exercises has a very calming voice 
There are masks and sleep stories for anyone wanting to use the masking technique 
There is also support for hyperacusis which I also developed which ultimately led to me getting the app. I can say that has gone aswell. 

Sometimes I think its too good to be true that something as simple as CBT and breathing can make such a difference. But every time I stop using the app for a few weeks I notice the tinnitus and hyperacusis creeping back. Then I start the exercises again and they go. 

The benefits of these practices are also great for anyone who suffers from anxiety and stress. Sometimes if something is stressing my out I’ll use the CBT techniques I’ve learnt here on those instead of the tinnitus. So you’re giving yourself the ability to overcome anything that’s holding you back in life, which is a superpower really.

5480,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,08/07/2022,Amazing ! But...,"I randomly stumbled upon this app when going down a rabbit hole on the app store, bored just scrolling to see what cool apps were featured these days. After downloading & opening I was amazed to see an app like this, seeing nothing of its kind before. I think it’s brilliant, beautiful, & can definitely be quite helpful to many people for lots of reasons. However, my only reason for giving 4 stars is due to the limited access of features the app offers when using the basic version (meaning not paying a subscription for the premium version). I know we live in a capitalist world, nothing is ever totally free & also understand we utilize our creative skills to find ways to generate ourselves a living. Majority of apps these days have in app purchases & / or subscription options, some charging more or less than others as well as some apps offering more or less features with/without subscribing for the premium access. This is totally fine considering for most apps this is just an option however, I just wish this app in particular offered just a little bit more for the basic/free version. Mainly considering for #1 how it can be more helpful to many people rather than just your typical leisure app like game apps & #2 the cost of everything just seems to keep rising right now in 2022 hence $ is tight for many’s basic necessities let alone app subscriptions (especially considering i mentioned nearly every app either already costs $ or requires a subscription for many of some apps features).",neutral,"[""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]"

5487,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,26/06/2022,Expensive But Gorgeous!,"In trying to find something to help me sleep peacefully, I’ve tried several apps. I wanted something soothing to play through the night. I tried a few relaxation apps and they were all fine with their white noise and raindrops, but nothing really captivated me. 

Then after seeing it come up so many times in my App Store searches, I tried Portal. Wow! Seriously WOW! These sounds are gorgeous! So rich, dimensional and lush! The visuals so cinematic! I would fire up a thunderstorm or windswept mountain peak and let my mind drift off. 

I liked the free offerings so much I tried the 7-day free trial and fell in love with several of the subscription soundscapes. But that price! As tempted as I was, I just couldn’t bring myself to spend that much right now. It was the $25 offer pop-up that convinced me to go for it. I’ve since started using the app to help me focus while reading, tried it with my headphones, and just tried one of the breathing exercises! It’s truly impressive! The developers have clearly put a lot of thought and effort into to making sure this isn’t just another cute collection of nature sounds. 

My only quibble is the price. To be fair, the developers acknowledge not everybody can afford this and don’t just brush off criticism with an “If you don’t want to pay, go somewhere else” attitude. Definitely a plus in my book. 

I’d love to see a smart TV app in the future, as the immersive sound and stunning visuals would be perfect for the medium. 

Whether you can afford a subscription or not, I highly encourage anyone looking for a relaxation app to give this one a shot. It’s one of the best!",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]"

The UI isn’t perfect and I’m frustrated by the video quality (on some portals), it’s as though a larger imagine has been cropped and zoomed in. A little soft on my IPhone 13, the image could and should be much clearer. Sharp and HD. Not great. 

Secondary, the price. £6.99 a month is a lot! In this day and age you have to weight up your monthly outgoings. And when the basic Netflix is £10.99, you have ask yourself, does this provide enough content/experience for the money? The answer is no. Even if half the price of Netflix, it does not. Amazon Prime £7.99. Compare the two? Nope. Doesn’t come close. Apple TV + £4.99 per month, your app is more expensive!! 

Sorry. But it’s just too much. Way too much. And nope, I don’t feel the need to pay you upfront for a year in advance. I’d rather the money was in my bank than yours. I wish you all the best though. Good luck.",negative,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Video"", ""Devices""]"

5543,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,04/03/2022,Great Quality App… but pricing is odd,"Update: I appreciate the thoughtful response, and it’s good to hear about the native Mac app on the way! Also appreciative of the great free portals to enjoy. Look forward to following along as this app grows.

Love the sound quality and visuals of this app, especially since it uses less data than loading up YouTube to listen to raindrop sounds. I feel like the premium plan is asking me to pay for features I can’t use though, so for that reason I have not upgraded. They clearly have priced the subscription high to reflect the extra features like Nanoleaf integration and spatial audio, but I don’t own nanoleafs or one of the specific 3 types of headphones that can support spatial audio… and I’m not going to buy another pair of headphones after investing in a nice Sony pair already. I wish there was a pricing tier just for more portals for those of us who can’t make use of the other features that require additional pricey external purchases. I’m sure I’m not the only person who’s money they’ve missed out on due to the high price tag. I just want to listen to some background audio while in my work cubicle to drown out coworkers! Again, the quality of what’s being offered is great, just too pricey for something that only gives its full value to select few people who own all the right accessories.",neutral,[]

5562,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,09/02/2022,Amazing UI and Phenomenal Customer Service,"I was initially resistant to try Portal because of concerns about getting to interested in an app with a high subscription cost. However, the nice permanent free offering convinced me that some things are worth it. This app is extraordinary. First, it respects your privacy and collects no data on you which is a rarity these days. Then, if you love soundscapes you will not find a better program to transport you around the world. The sound quality is excellent and the time between loops is long enough to be near imperceptible. The UI makes exploring interesting and seamless. Integration with the 3D audio is great too though I usually do have my phone use speaker or Bluetooth. My only gripe is if my phone is not plugged in overnight, the background battery usage can be more than I expect (10-15%) on an IPhone 13 Pro, as the battery usage chart shows it is active overnight. This may be nothing though. I had questions and a problem with purchasing the app and the team could not have been more helpful. I hope one day the permanent purchase price is more affordable.

5623,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,28/11/2021,Great app…..but..,"I’ve rated this 5 stars because it’s designed very well. The interface is beautiful, the sounds and sights are well done, and the app really does immerse me into a peaceful mindset. I’ve tried all of the apps to help me as I have been diagnosed with permanent PTSD. Finding the right mindful app is hard. Some have poorly recorded loops that take away from the immersion. Portal is done very well. I have sampled all of their offerings on the trial. So, the only problem with this app is the price. The developers priced this out of my ability. During tough times economically treating my PTSD with an app that has a decent amount of scenes, but is certainly limited to a couple dozen only, I would certainly pay a reasonable cost, but the monthly, yearly, and lifetime costs are just to high for what you get. Is it worth it? Maybe?, but it’s to costly when you consider you can get access to the entire YouTube library including the beautiful sounds and scenery scapes in 4k with no ads for around the same price monthly. Portal is a fantastic app, priced so that many can’t afford to use it to the full potential. That’s to bad. Subscription based gets out of hand on the App Store. All of the developers lose out with this model because we all have enough subscriptions already!! For what Portal offers, I just can’t justify the costs in tough times. I think a better long term model would be a free app with in-app purchases of the library from user submitted projects. The ones that get approved by Portal get downloaded at single purchase dlc. Portal makes money and gives a stipend to the users who win a seat on the Portal Library shelf. This would encourage new portals to be created by travelers and artists, grow the library into a store, and keep making money over time. Don’t forget to pay Apple! But, as it stands, hundreds for a lifetime unlock is just to high with no guarantee the developers won’t abandon the app next year. We all have been burned by that. I want to certainly reward app developers for great work, and this app is fantastic.Fortunately, I will still have a few free portals that are amazing when the trial is over, but I just can’t afford the decent, but not overwhelming amount of portals to unlock. I still give it 5 stars, because I’m rating the app, not the price. Outstanding app however. Maybe I’ll catch an unlock sale one day, because it will be worth it. Be safe all!",neutral,[]

Probably one of the most important things to know about VoiceOver is that you touch an item on the screen to have voiceover speak that item, and when it has spoken the item you want to activate, then you double tap quickly anywhere on the screen to activate that item on the screen. Anyone can probably learn more about this by going to settings, accessibility, voiceover, and then clicking on the voice over practice icon. In order for a certain app to work correctly with voiceover, certain parts of the app need to be programmed in a specific way. Unfortunately, this is where this app that I'm reviewing here lags behind, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five. There are some areas of this app that work better with voiceover than other areas of this app, however, areas where this app does not seem to work with voiceover include areas like finding and activating the button to set alarms. Also, the actual process of changing the time for the alarm is inaccessible as well, however, maybe, that could've been resolved if the setting to change from an analog clock to a digital clock changed that when setting alarms as well rather than just changing that for viewing the clock on the main screen. Despite certain features not working for me due to inaccessibility with voiceover, I can still enjoy opening a Portal whenever I want, and turning it off whenever I'm done. I would imagine that typical users of the app would swipe left and right to go between portals, and swipe up to close the portals. Some thing that surprised me about voiceover was that I was able to double tap and drag left and right to go between portals, as well as double tapping and dragging upward to close the portals. Not all apps seem to handle that kind of scenario with voice over in the same way. Overall, I still think this is a great app, because it is pretty unique.",mixed,[]

I thought it would be cool to have an electronic sound machine for when I have trouble falling asleep in the car. It started off with only 6 sounds and I thought that was pretty limiting. It had an option to pay a 1 time payment to unlock all the sounds it had to offer. So i paid that money and I have been enjoying portal ever since.Until now.

Second, I cast the app on my tv for the visuals which are quite relaxing until I realized they go on a 10-15 sec loop with almost seamless cross fade. 

Going to sleep with this… well… if you have a hyperactive brain like mine you will quickly realize that the sounds ( which are quite crisp and high definition) ALSO loop in a very short period of time.

5653,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,23/10/2021,Simply not worth the hype…,"I remember when Portal first came out, and the developer was chatting all around Reddit about it so I checked it out.

Fast forward to virtually the same experiences, just duplicated at different places and they want $9.99 a month or $249.99 for a lifetime…. NO, just no.

I wholeheartedly support indie developers, but this is the most absurdly greedy gimmick I think I’ve seen yet!  The lighting integration just sends a complementary color and some flickering to your Hue system, the “new content” is just repeating the same themes over and over, and the dynamic audio is something iOS and iPadOS will do automatically with your head movements anyway.

5736,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,United Kingdom,07/07/2021,Great quality - but expensive overall,"?? Pros: 

Excellent quality sounds - much better than many competing apps. The sounds are consistently lifelike and crisp, with great presence and depth.

Lovely visual design - serene visuals and an interface that encourages exploration.

Great engagement with users by the developers - as shown by responses to other reviews here.

?? Cons:

Pricing model - selling packs of sounds as one-off purchases would be preferable to a subscription-only model.

Value - this is hard to quantify. If you have an Apple Music subscription, then there are many great natural sound recordings available to stream. With Portal, the core value proposition is essentially the overall look and feel, consistent sound quality, and ease of browsing. Whether this is worth the price is subjective.

Loops - with some sounds that have very distinctive moments, it becomes easy to spot when they’re starting to repeat (e.g. crow calls in the spring dawn chorus). A bit of audio editing to shuffle things around could make this less obvious. ;)",positive,[]

Even after paying $6, I’m still locked out of over 50% of what this app offers. I know subscriptions aren’t going away anytime soon, but if you can find something else on the AppStore that has a consumer friendly business model, then I would go with that and pass on Portal.

If you’re fine with subscriptions, then I would recommend you still pass. At $40/year, it just doesn’t seem worth it for the amount of content and options you get.

5784,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,United Kingdom,21/05/2021,"Amazing sounds, confusing interface",The soundscapes on this are by far the best out there - and I’ve used almost all rain apps! So good with noise cancelling. Couple of things that let the app down though; the interface just seems overly complicated and I often find myself swiping up and down not knowing what I’m really doing. Seems a simple list might just do the job. Secondly it’s annoying that the sounds stop when you are browsing. Perhaps the my portals bit at the bottom could just be a now playing. Otherwise amazing.,positive,[]

Tried power cycling both the iPhone and both HomePods but still no sound from this app on AirPlay. Will revise review and rating if this ever gets fixed.

The first time I tried the alarm it worked great.  This morning I set it for 15 minutes before my normal alarm app was set to go off.  Not only did portal turn on a ‘silent’ alarm, it also silenced my regular alarm that was supposed to go off later, causing me to oversleep.  

The other issue is that there were multiple times when I went to the app to turn it on and it would show the pictures with no sound.

Die Audioqualität ist wirklich außerordentlich gut und die Übergänge zwischen den Loops sind quasi nicht wahrzunehmen. Ich benutze die AirPods Max und das Erlebnis ist einfach toll. Man fühlt sich wie an den Ort teleportiert und kann wunderbar entspannen.

I often have the thunderstorms playing in the background of my music, but when my music is too loud and I would rather hear more of the rain, it turns down both sounds. I would love nothing more than the ability to turn my music down and my soundscape up separately.

5806,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,07/05/2021,Beautiful design and impeccably crafted soundscapes,"I’ve used a number of different meditation/relaxation apps, and this is my new favourite.
I’m not that big on meditation and mostly use these apps to focus, relax or sleep. I like the fact that Portal specialises in nature sounds and doesn’t try to do everything (stories, meditation etc) like some of the others apps do. Although it remains to be seen if that changes later if Portal enjoys commercial success, grows its user base and tries to complete with the likes of Calm or Headspace. Personally I hope that never happens and Portal continues carving out its own nature-focused niche. :)

When it comes to the soundscapes themselves, I’m a little biased because I have visited some of the locations featured on the app, so listening to the sounds not only has a calming and a relaxing effect but also evokes fond memories. There is a lot more to like though: The UI is clean and very pleasant, the photos are professional looking and beautiful. The recordings are impeccable, and there is a good variety of different environments. As a keen traveller, I appreciate the short descriptions that accompany the sounds and show the team actually travelled to many of the locations and know something about them. I really prefer that to generic descriptions like “bubbling stream in a Japanese garden”. If you explore the company website, you see that they have a real connection to nature. This isn’t just another app with sounds on it.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate portal 9 because of two minor niggles:
1) If the app is already running and I put on my AirPods, the sound doesn’t start playing in them. I have to close and restart the app.
2) I thought the controls didn’t seem super intuitive at first - for example, when you pull up a portal, you have to tap on it again afterwards to “open” it and start the playback. Also, once you start the playback, the description disappears so it doesn’t seem to be possible to listen to the sounds and read about the place at the same time.

These details aside, this is an exciting app with its own character and story. I’m looking forward to following Portal’s journey.",neutral,[]

The free tracks from before subscribing were quite high quality, but some of the tracks you get in premium are a bit muffled or tinny or otherwise not as clear. Some of them are good though.

However, if I leave some portal on overnight, it eats my battery completely, and here’s why: there’s a timer for the sound, but I couldn’t find the timer for the screen or app itself. If I leave the portal on, the screen will be on until I manually turn it off. This makes it hard to use the “sleep” mode, because once you fall asleep (which is actually meant to happen with this mode, I guess?), the app will keep being on, using both the battery and the screen energy. Please, add the screen timer, if it’s still not there, because it would make the app so much easier to use! 

P.S. I would love to see the ocean themed portals in HD. Right now the quality is much worse than by the other portals.",mixed,[]
5816,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,Poland,03/05/2021,"Very pleased, just a couple of ideas","Wonderful experience, I use it for working, relaxing, almost all day sometimes. 

If I could give a couple of tips for further development is that for the breathing exercises  it would be nice to have the option of a sound feedback when I just want to close my eyes and not hold my phone in my hand (for the haptic feedback). Also stopping the exercise could be a little easier as I feel like there are too many taps required. I really hope that over time this feature gets developed further and the library of exercises gets expanded.

Other than that I am truly in awe of what an amazing work the developers of this app have done.",positive,[]
5817,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,01/05/2021,Great app! Great developers!!,"Updated review:
I just wanted to update review since last app update and say again, it was refreshing to see an app devoloper stay consitent, although they switched to a subscription model they did add a way to pay a 1 time fee, and although its more then the $4, still compared to other apps $30 for lifetime is far more reasonable. But most important thing to note is they allowed the users who previously paid the $4 to buy the app to keep the full version along with all the updates, so when you purchase from this devoloper you can be assured you will keep what you paid for regardless of any future changes in the pricing model, and that is hard thing to come by now a days in the apple world, so thankyou!

Suggestions: I also would love to see some more light autumn/forest sounds, maybe without birds (or at least light bird sound in distance and spread out a bit) in future, there are lots of water ones wich are great but more like the barley field one (wich is PERFECTLY done!) I would love!",neutral,[]

5819,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,30/04/2021,Forgotten Password,"This app isn’t the best. My reason of me saying that is because when I go to click Forgot Password and click to allow the app to send me a code using my email, the app won’t allow me to switch to Outlook to see the code and go back in this App. Therefore, refreshes each time and blocks me out. So, I decided to go on my laptop to go in my email so I can stay on this app to punch in the code. All of a sudden the app froze. I went back out and in but no results after a few tries. I decided to delete the app to then re-download. But the app won’t download. So, I just think the app is a waste for people who are new to it. Other apps are far better and faster to use. Finally, just as a marketer, I wouldn’t make the app so much to pay monthly. You can simply go other routes to drive business to money. For example, YouTube allows people to see great high definition images/videos such as this app but YouTube lets you do it for free. I hope this helps and brings attention to further the app and to overall be better.",negative,[]

The sounds are very realistic? not sure how to describe it, but it has great audio and it really sounds like you’re there. I also like how it says the location of the sounds and has the pictures. It’s a nice touch. I can relax and imagine myself being there, even while I’m working on a difficult project.

I paid for the subscription so I can listen to all the sounds, but if you don’t pay, you can listen to only 6. The subscription is $39/Year, but if you struggle with focus, sleep, or stress, it’s totally worth it. This is also the most aesthetic app I’ve ever seen.

As it’s such a relaxing app and great to have everything in one place... could you guys consider expanding on the breathing technique section. I know you’ve already got a few but what would be amazing is if you could integrate some others like the wim hof method etc. Or if there’s any issues with that maybe just a simple custom breathing section where you can dial it in like 4 second inhale 10 second hold 2 second exhale for 40 reps or whatever it is the user wants to dial in.

La qualità dell’applicazione, della UI, ma sopratutto degli audio mi ha davvero colpito e sinceramente, tra le altre applicazioni simili che ho provato in passato, non faccio fatica a dire che secondo me questa è la migliore, con l’audio più curato, con l’interfaccia più usabile e ottime funzionalità aggiuntive.

I have read the reviews on the App Store and agree with some of the critiques that a landscape option would be perfect as the speakers on the iPhone are at the base and at time the sounds do get blurred if the phone is on a stand. I have subscribed to the App and will definitely recommend it to friends and colleagues.  Your pricing is spot on and I have paid a higher price for your competitors, who are not a patch on your quality.  Secondly, you are a British based company and we should support you during these trying times.  I can imagine that this App will be spectacular on a iPad (their speakers are situated on the side).

The only reason why I have given this 4 stars & not 5 is because I’d love to make a request for one change or addition. I would love it if any future update enabled the live images to rotate into a horizontal view with the rotating of the phone & not just the current portrait view.   That way, it would be brilliant to pop my phone on its side & see a wide angle view of the beautiful footage on the app. 
I love the easy use. The varied choice of sounds & music is generous. The layout is stylish but also easy to navigate & to change between the different sounds. I listened to one of them today in the afternoon & I think I must’ve nodded off within minutes. One of my favourite apps. If any update allows the video live images to rotate with the phone into a horizontal view, I’ll give this a perfect 5.

After subscribing to the premium (which at first seemed a little pricey, however It’s clear that ALOT of work has gone into this app so with daily use it’s actually very reasonable) I am starting to find myself using the app more and more. (Backgrounds to meditation, reading etc) 

For the alarm I would like to be able to select various portals for randomisation as there’s some portals which I like and enjoy but are not particularly great at waking you up.

If you have headphones, use them……… Amazing right?

Some features I’d love to see implemented one day would be;

1. Ability to set Morning Mantra/Singing Bowl as the default alarm sound, as opposed to having to pick a portal (though I love the ability to choose a portal to wake up to also, sometimes I want to change it up a bit).

2. Support for Apple Health / Google Fit for sleep tracking. This is something that is important to me so would love to be able to use this as my default app, as currently I still have to use the clock or other sleep app to have an alarm set so it tracks.

I completely understand and believe that quality should not be free, but then I would like to see more sounds but also a few higher quality images and videos. The sound  quality is top notch, but the image quality suffers, making the app feel less “premium”.

Otherwise, I look forward to new Portals coming out. Some other ideas would be a watch app for portal, compatibility with spatial audio, or more breathing exercises, if any of those are feasible. I also look forward to trying Philips Hue integration in the near future.

Reply to devs:
Thank you for your reply. You should know that during the free trial period I used the app daily, multiple times a day, and was happy with it. I accept your explanation, but to me the good use I got out of it doesn’t justify the amount of yearly payment required. Even that yearly payment as a one off purchase for the app is something that I (and many more people I suspect) would consider. I can’t be the only one who feels like this. I have since found an app that was a one-off purchase for 16.99€, with many more, also originally recorded, sounds.

Wow! 
The app was already great.
The V3 update has taken it to another level. 

It could have been the case the best feature was the selection of top quality audio. But with V3 it’s not just functional as I find myself enjoying the navigation experience as though I’ve passed through a portal to a world of sounds. And it’s great. 

It’s not new but I want to say my standout feature is the ability to play in the background of other audio apps.

Edit: i like that the developer takes suggestions and responds to reviews, good customer service. But if i raise my volume my music will be too loud and if i keep it where it is it wont be loud enough :( The balance is off. I decided to give them another star. I REALLY enjoy that you can listen too “white noise” in the background while SIMULTANEOUSLY listening to something else. I have yet to find another FREE app that does a better job of this. The “white noise” also pairs really well with noise cancellation. Props to you guys. A few minor problems",neutral,[]

Update - thanks for your reply Nick, I understand your desire for a subscription model to help develop your business but it’s a pity you are missing out on the financial income of users who just want to enjoy the app as is, I won’t pay £30 for any app and I don’t do subscriptions but would definitely pay £10 to, say, gain access to six portals of my choice.

I just wanted to update review since last app update and say again, it was refreshing to see an app devoloper stay consitent, although they switched to a subscription model they did add a way to pay a 1 time fee, and although its more then the $4, still compared to other apps $30 for lifetime is far more reasonable. But most important thing to note is they allowed the users who previously paid the $4 to buy the app to keep the full version along with all the updates, so when you purchase from this devoloper you can be assured you will keep what you paid for regardless of any future changes in the pricing model, and that is hard thing to come by now a days in the apple world, so thankyou!

Suggestions: I also would love to see some more light autumn/forest sounds, maybe without birds (or at least light bird sound in distance and spread out a bit) in future, there are lots of water ones wich are great but more like the barley field one (wich is PERFECTLY done!)

I use it for mindfulness sessions or just as background noise in bed/bath/shower. I have noticed the developer/s take an active interest in comments which is why I am leaving a review. Definitely 5 star app. My suggestions for future updates would be as follows;
- landscape function for the images as portrait doesn’t do them enough justice
- this suggestion is probably way too complicated and heavy on the file size BUT just imagine how great it would be if the images were 360 and you could use your device to look around the scene.. or even just longer ‘walkthrough’ style vids would be awesome too
- finally I think in terms of other soundscapes could possibly branch out a bit more to have some odd ones like a busy train station or on a spaceship or maybe just more ocean related ones with seagulls etc. Sometime a sound of big crowds of people can be weirdly relaxing although the ones already on here are incredible!

One last thing - the pricing structure is just weird and doesn’t make much sense. Just stick with one off unlock price... makes way more sense!!!

6077,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,09/10/2020,I’ve been waiting....,"I’ve been waiting to review this app, since I wanted to spend a fair amount of time with it before I did. I remembered that I downloaded this app a while back when it was featured, but never used it. It came in clutch one night when I was at a friend’s house, couldn’t sleep at all, and all I could hear was the extremely loud crickets outside his door. It was not the nature sounds that I needed! Anyway, that night it saved me since I had a huge day the next day and was on a flight all the night before. I put on the fireplace sounds (I’m a sucker for the warm crackle of a fire) and I was OUT. I’ve since used it for everything from focusing on a really important deadline (ADHD is no friend of mine) or to escape when I’m feeling anxious. This app has been a beautifully designed, well curated panacea to many of my life’s ills. 

It’s tough for me to describe the impact that this simple ambient sounds app has had on my life. But I just want to say thank you to the wonderful humans who made this possible. I also upgraded to the premium version of the app, well worth the $. If you guys have other packs that you release, I would pay more happily. XO, John.

Note for the devs: please please please make the place descriptions more accessibility after downloading the portal itself, maybe from the pop up menu where you can change from sleep, focus and escape in the portal itself? I love reading the descriptions, but it’s tough to find later when I’m really enjoying a particular portal since I have to navigate back to the collection to do so.",positive,[]

It’s important to me that these are real, field recordings with amazing sound engineering, coupled with lovely visuals which help make sense of the sound. 

The looping is seamless and the extra bits like timer are super useful for working with the app. 

Can’t wait to see how it evolves. 

What I would also love to see:

Longer recordings or the option to loop longer recordings 

More winter stuff, I really love the one where you can here the wet snow falling

The sounds (and there is a lot to choose from!) are so crisp, good, and calming; I like reading the descriptions for the sounds :). I use it to fall asleep and to focus on my school work. Absolutely beautiful the user face interface, so visually pleasing and easy to use! A friend recommended it to me and now I recommend it to others. I love the responsiveness of the Portal team, this is an app definitely made with care.",positive,[]
6080,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,08/10/2020,Finally a reasonable sounds app! (Updated),"Updated review:
I just wanted to update review since last app update and say again, it was refreshing to see an app devoloper stay consitent, although they switched to a subscription model they did add a way to pay a 1 time fee, and although its more then the $4, still compared to other apps $30 for lifetime is far more reasonable. But most important thing to note is they allowed the users who previously paid the $4 to buy the app to keep the full version along with all the updates, so when you purchase from this devoloper you can be assured you will keep what you paid for regardless of any future changes in the pricing model, and that is hard thing to come by now a days in the apple world, so thankyou!

Suggestions: I also would love to see some more light autumn/forest sounds, maybe without birds (or at least light bird sound in distance and spread out a bit) in future, there are lots of water ones wich are great but more like the barley field one (wich is PERFECTLY done!) I would love!

Prev. Review:
It was refreshing to say the least to finally find a decent sounds app that not only allows you to try it for free and hear what your paying for first, but even more to only need to pay a reasonable 1 time price to keep using it. Its been years since Ive found new one worth keeping, so thankyou to developers for not charging crazy prices weekly and monthly just to listen to nature!

As to the app itself, the sounds are realistic, light, and they play with other audio AND have seperate volume control, everything I look for in a sounds app!

I love the gentle waves in the beach one and the soothing ocean sound in the pacific ocean, they are smooth and blend well in background with other apps, not to over powering. 

I would love to see more choices added in future, maybe some soft white noise and/or drone as white noise, and more gentle river, stream, and water/wave ones without added birds ect...with them. 

A suggested feature would be to allow mixing these sounds, or ability to customize them (like add or take out the birds and added ambience per scene) I personally just like the main sound, the river or ocean or wind, without the added nature, so I only use the 3 that are simple for now.

Overall I love it and was worth the $4 to own and even more to know I can always use it without stressing over paying for it every week or month to do so. I truly hope the developers keep updated it and added new scenes and features without taking away how well it works (wich so far they have been, so thankyou!) and id love to see more apps from these developers ;)

I use this app regularly to get to sleep as it provides a distraction for me to stop “over thinking” as I’m trying to drift off.

I thought perhaps a function from the app that may be nice would be to access your music library. I listen to classical music at bedtime and work sometimes and I’d like to have that with your nice backgrounds, if I’m using it while working at my desk or what have you.

I’m using an iPad Pro and am still having the occasional glitch of losing the sound when I’m switching around locations trying to decide which one I want. Not a big deal since I can just close the app to reset it. Doesn’t seem to be one particular thing that does it. I’m guessing it’s due to my having an older device.",neutral,[]

6154,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,02/09/2020,"So relaxing! Wonderful dynamic displays and sounds, and great interface.","My title sums my Portal experience up in brief.

I do not have many paid apps for my iPad, nor many apps in general, and am fairly selective about the apps I do download.

Portal was a real surprise to me, and worth paying for.  

The scenes are really beautiful, and more immersive than a typical relaxation app.  I was even very pleasantly surprised to see a local location (for me, Oregon, USA) included.

The interface menu is well thought out as well, even giving you a long (if not complete) preview of each of the lengthy, well looped, video dynamic themes, including their soundscapes.

When I’d started up Portal today, I was met with announcement that there had been a large update, which included more scenes, a “favorites,” function, etc.

Again, very pleased!

I honestly don’t think I could realistically ask for much more from this app. Mac version and an Android version would be a dream, though, frankly, my outdated iMac probably wouldn’t even be compatible.

Although I’m absolutely happy with current version, as my experience has been so rewarding, I’m keen to see what’s next. 

Part of the update walkthrough mentions that there will be scapes of Devon and Cornwall, to come. Portal Labs, you read my mind!

6183,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,23/08/2020,Incredible for Sleep and Getting Work Done,"This app was a game changer for me. I’ve always struggled to go to sleep. I have tried music, sleeping masks, white noise, muscle relaxation, etc. This app was really helpful in transporting me to beautiful, serene locations, putting my mind at ease, and finally allowing me to sink into the depths of unconsciousness at night, It’s soundscapes are beautifully realized visually, with varied, 3D immersive sound. I discovered that some of the soundscapes, especially the barley field and the cloud rainforest, were great aids to helping me write and work without getting distracted. Overall, the app has been a great improvement to my quality of life, which I did not expect initially.

I initially got the free version and was really satisfied with the included features, so I upgraded. I have to say the monetization model was really wonderful, encouraging me to support developers without making me feel like I had to pay for a good experience. Recently the app was updated with tons of new sounds from Scotland and Slovenia. It now includes a subscription model, but for the quantity and quality of content, it seems well worth it, especially because it will help the developers flesh out the app even more. On top of that, they gave everyone who had purchased the app free access to everything, which is incredibly generous! I look forward to great new content in the future.

The quality and presentation just blew my mind. The selection of portals were initially limited but of an incredibly high standard. It’s plain to see the care and love that’s been put into this.

I was absolutely delighted to find this huge new update with so many stunning portals to enjoy. And if that was not enough, I’ve been given a lifetime subscription as a thank you for my initial support and purchase. I don’t think I’ve ever felt as genuinely valued by a business, small or large as much as I do now.

This is now hands down the greatest value I’ve ever gotten from a App Store purchase. This app makes every day just that little bit better. Thank you so much, and thanks also to all the others who supported this app and made this possible!

As for suggestions - being able to access this via a browser would be amazing, especially when we’re desk bound and at work. Similar to how it works on the calm site. 

I like the idea of little virtual portal walks also. Videos that take you on a little scenic stroll for some beautiful landscapes.

Wow! 
The app was already great.
The V3 update has taken it to another level. 

It could have been the case the best feature was the selection of top quality audio. But with V3 it’s not just functional as I find myself enjoying the navigation experience as though I’ve passed through a portal to a world of sounds. And it’s great. 

It’s not new but I want to say my standout feature is the ability to play in the background of other audio apps.
I listen to podcasts and talk radio (and sometimes Spotify) a lot so without that feature this app would not be as integrated into my daily routine as it has become since I discovered it.

6200,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,20/08/2020,Finally a reasonable sounds app! (Updated),"Updated review:
I just wanted to update review since last app update and say again, it was refreshing to see an app devoloper stay consitent, although they switched to a subscription model they did add a way to pay a 1 time fee, and although its more then the $4, still compared to other apps $30 for lifetime is far more reasonable. But most important thing to note is they allowed the users who previously paid the $4 to buy the app to keep the full version along with all the updates, so when you purchase from this devoloper you can be assured you will keep what you paid for regardless of any future changes in the pricing model, and that is hard thing to come by now a days in the apple world, so thankyou!

Prev. Review:
It was refreshing to say the least to finally find a decent sounds app that not only allows you to try it for free and hear what your paying for first, but even more to only need to pay a reasonable 1 time price to keep using it. Its been years since Ive found new one worth keeping, so thankyou to developers for not charging crazy prices weekly and monthly just to listen to nature!

As to the app itself, the sounds are realistic, light, and they play with other audio AND have seperate volume control, everything I look for in a sounds app!

I love the gentle waves in the beach one and the soothing ocean sound in the pacific ocean, they are smooth and blend well in background with other apps, not to over powering. 

I would love to see more choices added in future, maybe some soft white noise and/or drone as white noise, and more gentle river, stream, and water/wave ones without added birds ect...with them. 

A suggested feature would be to allow mixing these sounds, or ability to customize them (like add or take out the birds and added ambience per scene) I personally just like the main sound, the river or ocean or wind, without the added nature, so I only use the 3 that are simple for now.

Overall I love it and was worth the $4 to own and even more to know I can always use it without stressing over paying for it every week or month to do so. I truly hope the developers keep updated it and added new scenes and features without taking away how well it works (wich so far they have been, so thankyou!) and id love to see more apps from these developers ;)

ORIGINAL REVIEW: All apps should be this thoughtfully designed. Well done. Absolutely well done.

Portal is not only beautiful to look at, the design and flow are natural, the controls sensible and placed where you’ll look for them, and the entire experience speaks to a designer/team who really cares about the users’ experience and frame of mind. Kudos. Most app designers would do well to study Portal as an excellent example of clear, well balanced, user-experience-centric app design.

I read about it today on MacStories, and I only wish I’d discovered it earlier. Not only because it’s wonderful, but because they’re offering a host of grandfathered lifetime payment options to previous users, none of which are available to new users.

I don’t do subscriptions, period. It has to do with being a freelancer and a feeling of uncertainty about committing to an ongoing payment when I don’t know the future. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to - and do - support developers and pay for apps... I simply (and only) use one-time payment options. I understand the benefit of subscriptions to developers; there are plenty of us who simply cannot use that option to support good apps and well-used apps though, and I really hope the developers here study the issue, and come up with a purchase option going forward, vs only subscription. I’d buy that.",neutral,[]

To anyone reading this, this is easily worth the price of subscription at this point since it seems like there’s going to be more and more sounds that are going to be put out.

In summary keep up the great work and I really appreciate the team taking care of their original customers instead of pushing them out like some other apps that transition to subscriptions have done. Also was this a one time promotion for original purchasers or would I be a lifetime subscriber? If it’s the latter then I’m going to be incredibly happy ??.",neutral,[]

The sounds are outstanding—it really feels like you’re there! I find the Umpqua River sound to be the best for relaxing me, but others are great too. The visuals are excellent as well, but I find that just playing the sound through earbuds is a great way to keep me calm and relaxed. This app has greatly reduced my stress level and increased my productivity and, no, the developer didn’t ask me to say that.

I happily paid the one-time fee for the app a few months ago—very much worth it. It’s such a good app that I’ve recommended it to mental health professionals to mention to their clients as a way to relieve stress and anxiety.

6235,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,13/08/2020,Utterly gorgeous,"All apps should be this thoughtfully designed. Well done. Absolutely well done.

Portal is not only beautiful to look at, the design and flow are natural, the controls sensible and placed where you’ll look for them, and the entire experience speaks to a designer/team who really cares about the users’ experience and frame of mind. Kudos. Most app designers would do well to study Portal as an excellent example of clear, well balanced, user-experience-centric app design.

I read about it today on MacStories, and I only wish I’d discovered it earlier. Not only because it’s wonderful, but because they’re offering a host of grandfathered lifetime payment options to previous users, none of which are available to new users.

I don’t do subscriptions, period. It has to do with being a freelancer and a feeling of uncertainty about committing to an ongoing payment when I don’t know the future. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to - and do - support developers and pay for apps... I simply (and only) use one-time payment options. I understand the benefit of subscriptions to developers; there are plenty of us who simply cannot use that option to support good apps and well-used apps though, and I really hope the developers here study the issue, and come up with a purchase option going forward, vs only subscription. I’d buy that.",neutral,[]

6243,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,10/08/2020,Be transported through a journey of sound!,"I love Portals, it's everything you could want in an ambient sounds app! It's easy to use and beautiful in every way! The soundscapes are very rich and immersive, and the almost still photography is simply gorgeous. With the full version, you get a nice mix of environments and sound elements. I have several favorites, so sometimes it's hard to decide which to use. This app may fuel wanderlust, so be warned! 

Even though the free version is plenty sufficient in terms of quality, it's 1000% worth it to upgrade to the full sound library. Considering the handy features and number of high-quality sound portals you get in the full version, $5.99 is exceptionally affordable. I really appreciate that this isn't a subscription-based service; why not get the full version and support some amazing developers? 

 Note: Some people here are confused about the 3 modes (focus, sleep, escape) within the full version. By choosing one of these modes, you're selecting a more specific method for interacting with the app. Focus mode has a focus timer and checklist, Sleep has a sleep timer and alarm clock, and Escape has breathing exercises. The sound portals you have access to are the same regardless of what mode you're in.

6251,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,Germany,05/08/2020,"Amazing and immersive UI, Sounds great, Videos too short","Hi there.

First of all - it is a long time since i installed another app besides my all-time classic MyNoise, which is an excellent app, too. But yours has a feature MyNoise is missing. Immersive and truly beautiful videos to go along with the sounds.

But i think you can build upon the video-aspect of your app a little more. I am a psychologist with a counselling office. I can imagine hanging a screen on the wall, playing your sounds and showing your amazing videos to calm down patients before the session.

But the videos you provide are really too short and repeat themselves much too early. Maybe you can add more and extended footage? Longer videoloops lasting at minimum minutes per portal will enhance the immersion of the app by miles. I think it could be an option - or an in-app purchase for those who want spend more time with this feature. 

What do you think about that?
Is it feasible? Or is this an issue because of hard-drive space or performance?

Many greetings,
Manuel",neutral,[]
6252,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,04/08/2020,Perfect execution,"This app is really amazing all around. It has pleasing aesthetic, a beautiful and easy user interface, a great/generous free selection of sounds, and nice settings options. A lot of time and love was put into this app and it shows. I love the one time purchase. That is always a big plus for me and for $7 it is a steal for what you get. Of course I purchased it. Even if the free sounds are good enough for me, you deserve the money. 

I love the ability to add a Siri shortcut, but one thing I was a bit disappointed about it was that I can’t create a shortcut with Siri for each specific sound in the app. This isn’t a major problem because I can just make my shortcuts in the shortcut app, but it would be nice to have the ability make a shortcut within the app for each sound without that Siri option with the app only being able to be used for one specific shortcut. I hope what I am saying is making sense. Really, though, this was just an observation and doesn’t need to be done at all!

I think being able to see what you are hearing is absolutely brilliant and adds so much more depth to the app. The only thing I don’t like about it is that if you plan to add more sounds in the future it will take longer for it to get in our hands because it can’t be easy to source amazing footage like that! With that said I hope to see and hear more sounds in the future! Amazing job!

6274,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,15/07/2020,Finally a reasonable sounds app!,"It was refreshing to say the least to finally find a decent sounds app that not only allows you to try it for free and hear what your paying for first, but even more to only need to pay a reasonable 1 time price to keep using it. Its been years since Ive found new one worth keeping, so thankyou to developers for not charging crazy prices weekly and monthly just to listen to nature!

As to the app itself, the sounds are realistic, light, and they play with other audio AND have seperate volume control, everything I look for in a sounds app!

I love the gentle waves in the beach one and the soothing ocean sound in the pacific ocean, they are smooth and blend well in background with other apps, not to over powering. 

I would love to see more choices added in future, maybe some soft white noise and/or drone as white noise, and more gentle river, stream, and water/wave ones without added birds ect...with them. 

A suggested feature would be to allow mixing these sounds, or ability to customize them (like add or take out the birds and added ambience per scene) I personally just like the main sound, the river or ocean or wind, without the added nature, so I only use the 3 that are simple for now.

Overall I love it and was worth the $4 to own and even more to know I can always use it without stressing over paying for it every week or month to do so. I truly hope the developers keep updated it and added new scenes and features without taking away how well it works (wich so far they have been, so thankyou!) and id love to see more apps from these developers ;)

6303,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,Switzerland,25/06/2020,Beautiful interface with lack of configuration,"Beautifully made app with ambient sounds and quite nice videos (some better than others).
The distinguishing factor surely is the elegant user interface and its three modes focus, sleep and escape. Another highlight is the simple integration with Philips Hue light system.
The sounds are the same in all modes from whales to thunderstorms. The functions within the modes differentiate:
* In focus you set a goal to be remined on what you want to focus during the time. At the end of the timer you will be gently reminded.
* Sleep offers an alarm clock (that doesn't work). The timer in this case will turn off the sounds.
* In escape you will find some breathing exercises and the timer will not turn off the sound but end in a subtle alarm mode. It seems sufficient for a nap, where at the end you want to be reminded to get up again.

Haptics are great for the Hue sync: increasing or decreasing the intensity of light has the feel of a real dial. Really well done. Unfortunately, there is not much to configure with the Hue lights. The colour (many are somewhere in the area of white) are predefined and cannot be modified. Or they do not change with the colour shift in the videos (like with the Hue sync box). Especially with the cracking fire I would have expected some automatic adjustments (at least in the escape mode).
The light control is also missing when falling asleep. The intensity stays the same until the timer is up. As is the sound. There is no subtle fade out of light and sound.
I would assume this is the same with the alarm clock. But it does not work. I should have expected it, as there are many setting options (backup alarm and alarm warnings) that give you the feeling it is not reliable, well, it does not work at all.
The app cannot connect to AirPlay speakers on its own, which defeats the purpose to have it as an alarm clock. They warn you that you should be listening with headsets, but I am not sleeping with them put on, so the support of the speaker option would seem mandatory.
The videos are nice, but they do not loop nicely in all cases. Some like the jungle one just jumps back. I would have expected an endless loop, in the case of the jungle just a 360° shot.",mixed,[]

6325,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,15/06/2020,Wow- ??,"Not EVEN going to lie, this app is pretty amazing! The nature sounds are so calming, & they easily calm me down when I’m angry or stressed. I mostly use it for sleep though. I have trouble sleeping, so the nature noises along with the music I put on really helps. It drowns out the silence when one of the songs ends & a new one begins. I’d love to buy the premium—the ocean sounds are probably my favorite of them all—but I still have to convince my parents to let me buy it. ?? They typically aren’t the kind of people that buy whatever they...
There are a few things I’d like to address about certain features. I’ve been having a slight issue with the mixing feature. I have an alarm separate from this app that goes off in the mornings. Lately, I’ve been sleeping in (but don’t tell anyone.??) I’ve been noticed that the nature sounds don’t ever continue playing after the alarm sounds. Well, they’re playing, but not playing? I have another alarm that goes off during the day, and the ambiance start randomly playing. I’m not sure if this is a glitch or if it’s my phone, but it’s slightly annoying.
Can you also make it so you can adjust the volume? I know that’s already a feature, but I can barely hear your audio over the playlist I use, & if I turn my phone volume up, it turns both of the volumes up, which doesn’t really help. I don’t have a way of turning my playlists volume down, & the ambiance’s volume is already at the max. Could you please do something about this?

Despite those two things, this is an amazing app! I definitely recommend it for help sleeping & relaxing!

Seriously thank you. i wouldn’t have been able to pull the trigger for a subscription but happy to buy DLC. The sound is exquisite and the video footage is gorgeous without obvious loops. The feature that got me the most excited and convinced me to buy the full version of the app was the ability to mix it with audiobooks and other apps. I’ve been looking for a way to add background sound to my Audible app when i listen to audiobooks for forever! Now this is my absolute Go-To for ambient sound. I leave my ipad by my bed with the ocean soundscape running while i fall asleep and i’m out. A great feature to add would be the ability to airplay it to an apple TV. Right now you can mirror your screen to the TV like you would with any other app but there’s not a built in casting feature. Still that’s just a wish list item for me. This app was made with love and care and special attention to a LOT of handy above and beyond features. It’s not a money grab and is excellent value for what you get. I hope the devs keep up the great work. Can’t wait to see what new environments come next! Maybe an urban setting or a coffee shop?  Or maybe more beautiful locations from around the globe.

6523,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,08/05/2020,Perfect Meditation App,"I don’t write reviews often at all. Last one I wrote was when I had my iPod touch 2nd gen. But I had to leave something here for this one. First, this is the perfect meditation app I’ve been looking for. For $4, and no other in app purchases, it’s extremely simple and accessible. Second, the addition of timers and allowing external sounds for other tasks is wonderful. I set a 20 minute timer in the app and played the thunderstorm sound and got lost in my head. It was a wonderful break from a time like this. I even fell asleep sitting in my chair briefly. I’m a 20 year old student who is also working and am constantly overwhelmed with everything going on in my life. This was the best experience I’ve had in a while and hope to keep using this app. I love it. Simple. Clean. Easy. Great work guys. Keep it the same please. I don’t need any other features, just hope more people use it.

On second thought, here are a few feature ideas I want to add:

1. The ability to create and share our own looping sounds on a “workshop”.

- I understand you guys want very very high quality sound clips with binaural audio, but there are some people out there who have great mics and would probably love to help expand the library. The high quality ones would rise to the top extremely quickly whereas low quality ones would sink to the bottom from a potential rating system. It could also be noted that all “unofficial” sounds are purely experimental and the level of quality of “official” sounds is not to be expected. 

- we can record a sound clip, decent limit on length, adjust the start and end manually with a slight overlap mixer.

- users would then add a picture/video to accommodate their new sound.

- UI would be super clean for that.

- I think it would start something not any other meditation app this clean, that I know of, has implemented.

- Can hide the custom mixer behind an “enable advanced feature” checkbox even before implementing an entire workshop which would be a lot bigger of a project.

2. More options for the timer alarm on “escape” or other modes.

- I found the gong one a bit alarming and eerie when it first went off.

- I’m sure I’d get used to it but it’s still creepy.

Just wanted to throw some ideas out there! I know the first one would take MONTHS to implement and the second is just a nitpick, but I would love to see this app grow!",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Camera & Photos"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Gaming"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Video"", ""Devices""]"

I feel most apps either have one thing I need and missing the other when it comes to calm and relaxation. I don’t feel calm or relaxed by listening to voices compared to many other apps out there for similar techniques.

It lulls me to sleep every night, I use it to focus on work and if I need a catnap during the day, it has a great timer that doesn’t scare you awake, it simply changes the sounds to something with an irregular beat that will ease you out of sleep. 

The visuals are gorgeous, although I had an issue in a previous version that froze the visuals and failed to turn the screen off all night so I’m afraid of leaving it on (is that fixed?)

Developers respond very quickly so I have a couple of requests:

1. I have a few favourite sounds but I’d like some more variety. My top request: raining in the city. When are you expecting to release new sounds?

2. I’d like to use this directly with my HomePod. Some apps transfer the Siri Shortcut to the HomePod and activate there. Portal says “You need to continue on your iPhone”. I like to leave my phone in a different room when I go to bed but that won’t work for Portal. 

3. I’d prefer dynamic Philips Hue scenes. Some apps emulate the soft flicker of a fireplace or an undulating effect for under water scenes. Portal just keeps a constant light colour.",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Update"", ""Devices""]"

6549,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,29/04/2020,Finally a reasonable sounds app!,"It was refreshing to say the least to finally find a decent sounds app that not only allows you to try it for free and hear what your paying for first, but even more to only need to pay a reasonable 1 time price to keep using it. Its been years since Ive found new one worth keeping, so thankyou to developers for not charging crazy prices weekly and monthly just to listen to nature!

As to the app itself, the sounds are realistic, light, and they play with other audio AND have seperate volume control, everything I look for in a sounds app!

I love the gentle waves in the beach one and the soothing ocean sound in the pacific ocean, they are smooth and blend well in background with other apps, not to over powering. 

I would love to see more choices added in future, maybe some soft white noise and/or drone as white noise, and more gentle river, stream, and water/wave ones without added birds ect...with them. 

A suggested feature would be to allow mixing these sounds, or ability to customize them (like add or take out the birds and added ambience per scene) I personally just like the main sound, the river or ocean or wind, without the added nature, so I only use the 3 that are simple for now.

Overall I love it and was worth the $4 to own and even more to know I can always use it without stressing over paying for it every week or month to do so. I truly hope the developers keep updated it and added new scenes and features without taking away how well it works (wich so far they have been, so thankyou!) and id love to see more apps from these developers ;)

6555,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,20/04/2020,Incredible,"I can’t truly express how much I love this app! Right off the bat, the app’s appearance is sleek, modern, and overall gorgeous. The UI is seamless and allows for quick jumping between environments. The visuals alone are enough to strike awe in any user, with pristine living landscapes that unfurl with just a swipe or two of your finger. Then there’s the sound... absolutely stunning. The audio within each portal is crisp and clear. As another user mentioned, it’s very difficult to recognize where the audio loops, making it incredibly wonderful to use when working or going to sleep. I have found that other ambiance apps or sound machines simply do not have enough variety in their sounds or have audio that too clearly loops banal, short, overused sound clips. Overall, this app stands well above the rest, with absolutely beautiful audio and visual elements that transport the user around the globe with just a few swipes of the finger.

A few additional notes:
I have the full version of the app (after paying for the small in-app purchase to unlock the rest of the sounds) and can definitely say it is worth it. 
I love the idea of connecting with a smart light to change the whole ambiance of the room. I have one smart light in a lamp that I was hoping to use with the app, but unfortunately it requires a philips hub, which I do not have. That being said, it is not difficult to assign the portals to custom colors in the Philips Bluetooth app.
Though I love the app as it is, I want to just second the suggestion, brought up by another user, to add at least one portal with an urban environment.

6574,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,United Kingdom,29/03/2020,"Wonderful - I don’t think I could live without it, now that I’ve tried it.","This app has literally changed my life - and, no, I don’t usually say this kind of thing. 

In all of the technology I’ve used, I’ve never come across something that actually improves my mental state. This app has let me find a calm an peace that I’ve not felt for over 20 years. Tonight, I even managed mindful eating while listening to the sounds of mountain air and birds and my evening meal tasted better than ever I thought it could. Any other time I would have settled for videos or reading while eating, just for something for my mind to do. 

I bought the premium version to get access to the springtime barley field. The key thing that makes this app so wonderful (aside from the minimalist design) is the combined soundscapes and timer. It makes me feel like I’m outside in a forest, or sitting in sunlit meadow, while working or cleaning. 

I live in a city but I love nature and the outdoors. Locked down for the covid-19 pandemic, I can’t even go for a walk in the sunshine. This app... is an absolute lifesaver and it’s finally given me an entirely distraction-free soundscape to live my life to. No more getting distracted by YouTube while trying to find something to help me concentrate. No more rude awakenings by raucous ads. No more living my life with my nose in a book or listening to reddit threads all day just to have something to break up the sounds of the city. I can finally, finally, think in peace. 

Thank you to the developers for this. It is a program far greater than the sum of its parts.

Portal fixes both of these problems. Especially once you open up the full library, the sounds it provides are amazing and perfect for helping you focus or escape. All of it’s sounds are amazing and I’ve gotten a real boost in efficiency thanks to the app. My only wish is for more sounds. The 14 they provide are all very effective and neat, but I’m very tempted to ask for more. For instance: they provide mainly nature sounds form around the world.

6624,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,11/02/2020,Amazing!,"I just downloaded this app, and I am so happy that I did. I’ve been looking for a decent app that plays sound like this for awhile. It helps me to sleep or really focus when I am studying. Some of the other apps just haven’t done it for me, and while searching for a new one I found Portal. You get a few “portal’s” for free, but have to purchase the rest. For me, this wasn’t an issue. I happily paid the $3.99 to unlock all the features as a one-time payment. Some apps make you pay for each separately, so it was nice to only have to pay once to unlock it all. The sounds are so crystal clear and sound great. The look and feel of the app is also very nice. You can hook it up to philips hue lights which I don’t have yet, but plan on buying in the future so I think that will be cool. I really only have one complaint. In the portals there is a guided breathing exercise, and it tells you on the screen when to breathe in and out. I really wish there was a way to have it narrated for you. Sometimes I like to close my eyes when doing breathing exercises and obviously I can’t see the screen when my eyes are closed. Other then that, this app is awesome! 5 stars for sure.

6634,Portal - Immersive Escapes,iOS,USA,05/02/2020,"Love what I’m seeing, but could be improved","I generally don’t write app reviews,  but I wanted to for this one because 1) I think it’s awesome;   and 2) I really would love to see this get more features and be added upon. What is there right now is a wonderfully clean, clever interface. The modern design is very sleek, I love the ability to sync with my lights, and I love the user interface and the visuals. The price is also great. I hate that every app nowadays is moving toward a monthly or annual premium subscription. The premium version of this app is a one time flat fee, and I gladly paid it. 

As for what I would like to see improved, I would like the sync with the lights to be more of a “living” space, that makes the room I’m in more dynamic rather than just changing the color to a static, unchanging state. In the thunderstorm for example, it would be awesome to have slight changes in the brightness and color of the lights to sync with the clap of thunder, and have that be adjustable on my end how dramatic the effect in my room is. The sound mixer is also kind of pointless right now. It’s a nice thought, but iOS devices don’t allow for volume control between apps, which means your music (or whatever you are trying to mix with the ambient noise audio) is always going to be AT LEAST as loud as the sound from Portal, if not louder (unless the other app you’re mixing audio with has independent audio controls like Portal does, but most don’t and just rely on the phones system volume (this is true for YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, etc). That being the case, I don’t hardly ever use the gesture because I want the sound from Portal to be louder with quiet music in the background, but this isn’t really possible. I recognize it’s not Portal’s fault, and it’s a nice attempt and I appreciate the feature is there, but I just don’t see the use case for it. 

Finally, the scenes are limited right now. The ones that are there are appreciated, but for a premium app, I kind of expected there to be more scenes. I’m sure these will come over time and I eagerly await to see what the developers have in store for us.",neutral,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Connectivity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]"

It has had a big update. More sounds, more options for sounds, and an AMAZING feature that allows the sound from the app play on top of sounds from other apps. This means I can use meditation apps alongside the soundscapes from Portal. 

The new sounds are incredible. The update was only released yesterday, so I have only used the new update for one mediation sitting - but I’m blown away. 

This is a great update and the app is now terrific value for money. Quality work from the developers.

Really looking forward to future updates now (which I hope could include sounds from the shore of a Scottish loch, rain in a Japanese forest, breeze and bird song of a Mediterranean island, sea and wind sounds from Ireland’s west coast, the Louisiana Bayou...)

I also like the background activity, and the mix with other apps feature, because I can listen to audio books or meditations from another app while listening to this app as well.

The only thing I would ask for is better VoiceOver support. I am able to navigate through the list of sounds, and figure out basic things in the app, but I can't use other features like the timer, the breathing exercises you provided in the app, and the sleep alarm function.

6739,Quieten : Tinnitus Relief,iOS,USA,18/08/2021,An affordable way to treat tinnitus,"When my tinnitus and hyperacusis were at their worst, I considered getting Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT), a treatment which has become a gold standard in tinnitus rehabilitation.  Certainly, the idea has been revolutionary and it has helped many people, which I think is commendable.  However, anyone interested in getting that therapy should know that it costs 5,000-6,000 dollars presently, it is not covered by insurance, and requires a one year commitment (it apparently takes around 3-6 months to notice any results at all).  With it being way out of my price range, I decided to give Julian's approach a try, and honestly, the results I have gotten from just 6-7 WEEKS of Julian's treatment have probably given me about the result I would have gotten from about 6-8 MONTHS of TRT; it just took way less time and was way cheaper.  I paid about 180 dollars for two sessions with Julian, and a few hundred for craniosacral therapy.  That was it.  The exercises cost nothing, and the yoga DVD was what, 20 bucks?  Also, TRT does not actually cure tinnitus, it only helps manage the condition.  Julian's approach CAN eliminate tinnitus entirely, as I have eliminated the tinnitus in my left ear since using his approach.  So, Julian's approach is cheaper, takes less time, and seems capable of ridding me of the tinnitus in my right ear as well.  With all due respect to TRT, this is simply a no-brainer, especially for those who are on a tight budget.",mixed,"[""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users""]"

Recently I discovered Quieten. I started using it this month with a new client who had consulted several other doctors before he came to see me. He was in a highly agitated state, unable to sleep more than two hours a night due to what he called “the screaming in my ears.“ In addition, he was having panic attacks and was more claustrophobic than ever. I recommended Quieten along with some breathing and mindfulness exercises. We recently had our fourth visit, and the patient now affirms that he is able to sleep soundly (and he has Fitbit data to corroborate that). Moreover, he has had no panic attacks and was able to undergo an MRI procedure without claustrophobic interference.

6773,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,28/06/2022,Wonderful app!,"I absolutely love the Rain, Rain app. I’ve had a subscription for a little over a year, and just now reviewing it. I believe non-subscribers can use some of the sounds. In my opinion, one quality that sets this app apart from perhaps others is the list of sounds (there’s quite a few) and how authentic they sound, and now and then a new one is listed. My VERY favorite part of the app is the blending of the sounds. The creator of the app has mixes he has made if you want to use them, but you can create your own mixes, and I believe you can blend up to 4 at-a-time. Then, you can remove or add them one-at-a-time with just a click. My favorite blend is rain (original) and rain on a tent. I have it begin at bedtime every night automatically. At times, I add the sound of the vinyl record going around and around, but a relative said it sounded like a merry go ‘round at a spooky amusement park and she couldn’t sleep listening to it. Me? It made me think of playing vinyl records growing up (have a large collection now) and music boxes I loved as a child. Anyway, there are sounds for everyone’s likes and wants.
I prefer this app from a smaller businessperson to those from larger businesses or corporations as I enjoy supporting such, which brings me to my last point… the support is awesome, usually prompt and friendly.

You can mix up to 3 sounds at once and you can favourite mixes so you can go back to them. My favourite mix is “ticking clock” and “rain on window” helps my relax into sleep.

Another wonderful thing about this app is that I am suchhh a light sleeper too many drips in the rain sounds will wake me up or too much thunder, so to be able change the volume of certain sounds im putting together is a life changer. Sometimes I’ll listen to podcasts with the rain sounds+thunder+raindripping and  I need my rain sounds to be a little louder then normal so I can hear the rain over the podcast it’s very wonderful because I can change that but keep the drips and thunderstorm at the same volume so they don’t wake me up , LOVE IT",positive,[]

Utterly adore that you can LAYER up to 3 sounds at once, and tweak how loud each one is. I’ve built my own ideal listening combos with this.

I sleep every night with my I-pad in my bed while listening to a stormy night complete with thunder rumbles. There's a variable timer so you can have it turn off later. This is great to drown out random noises like people talking nearby or the call to prayer at 5 a.m. I got labyrinthitis while in Kabul back in 2015 and developed tinnitus afterward.

7094,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,New Zealand,17/01/2022,Quite possibly the best app i’ve ever downloaded,"I’ve used this app since day one. Years, and years ago at this point, was the first time I downloaded it.
I’ve recommended it to family members, friends, and my partner.
They all use it. 
Never once has it let me down, and unlike most other apps when new updates are rolled out - it hasn’t lost its original touch.
I am gladly a subscriber, and not because I plan to utilise every sound there is to offer, but more so to show my appreciation to the developer.
I always dreaded the day where the app would no longer be available, because the reality is - there just isn’t anything quite like it.
The sounds are great, and loop really well, this means that if you’re quite the observer whilst trying to get to sleep, you won’t notice the loop patterns.
They are blended together in perfect harmony.
Honestly more than anything I just wanted to say thanks, as I believe my thanks is long overdue.",neutral,[]

I just use the basic sounds. It seems that because I am not purchasing anything else it’s going to start acting up. That’s very disappointing. It used to be the best app. But if I am going to have to purchase it to continue to use it, I guess I will have to use my desk top white noise sound. This was just more convenient.

7117,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Canada,27/12/2021,Been using this for years,"For the last couple years iv been using the app every night to sleep, I even wake up with it still playing with one head phone still in my ear lol 

I honestly can’t settle down and fall asleep without this app, it also helps block noise in the house or traffic. The bad side I can’t sleep without it now lol. I have to say thank you for creating this app. Iv been a loyal user and have no desire to switch apps. I hope this app stays in my life time. 

My choice in sounds to sleep are rain on a tent with volume half way, soften max, oscillate off. I combined this with crackling fire, volume about 80% range or very close to 90, soften max, oscillate off.
This sound put me to sleep :) 

Thanks again for this",positive,[]

Today, I installed it again so that I could see if it could help my husband who is having a sleep problem. I discovered that there is only a limited free trial and then I must subscribe. There is nothing about this in the description of the app. This is just another deceptive advertising gimmick to get someone to download a free version of the app and then discover that it is not really free.

7152,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,10/11/2021,"""To sleep perhaps to dream--""","I have two sleep disorders: sleep apnea and insomnia. Sleep apnea is simple to treat with a Cpap, but insomnia is not easy at all, not even with sleep medications.

 To make a long story short, I have tried everything to experience the luxury of a sound, deep, rejovenating sleep. Then I discovered Rain Rain.

 The first night I used the app, I slept 7 hours of uninterrupted, restorative sleep. I awakened to a sun-filled room and for a moment I was completely disoriented; my form of insomnia not only prevents me from falling asleep, it also awakens me three or four times a night -- always to a dark room. Sometimes I an able to return to sleep; other times that is impossible. 

I love this software: it runs perfectly, and I absolutely love the ""soften” option which I use it to soften the sound of thunder for every rain sequence I play; because rain is not rain without a pinch of rumbling, distant thunder.

 Using Rain Rain has made it possible to sleep like a normal person again. Even more importantly, various unrelated health issues have also improved because I now am able to experience 7 or 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. And I can remember my dreams again! What more can anyone ask?",positive,[]

7158,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,06/11/2021,Highly recommended,"I picked this app up years ago, before the switch to a subscription service. I picked up the packs for the sounds I wanted and used it regularly on an old iPad whenever I needed some comforting white noise. When I got a new iPad, I saw it switched to a new subscription service, which I’m not fond of, but I still had access to all the previous sounds I bought in addition to some extra credits to buy new, individual sounds they added in updates. I’m really pleased that I was allowed to keep what I had previously paid for and that I wasn’t forced into the subscription service. It’s also still a really high-quality app. I really like the ability to mix sounds to create custom soundscapes, modifying the volumes, softness, and oscillation of each one, and then letting me save those to favorites. The only thing I could complain about was that I had to use the rain on the car roof sound much less, because it tended to make me want to fall asleep while actually driving in the rain. That sound is really comforting though, along with rain on a tent. I always recommend Rain Rain to people looking for something to help with sleep!",positive,[]

7198,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,10/10/2021,They got greedy- but the free mode is still good,They changed to monthly subscriptions instead of letting you make a one time payment for sounds you like.

But I use the free parts only. It’s really too bad that it uses the subscription model. I would pay a for some new sounds if it was a pay by sound model. There is no way I’d pay the hefty subscription fees. And subscription for what? Is there really enough new content regularly to justify a subscription? I’ve been using the app for at least a year and haven’t noticed any new sounds yet. Maybe because I don’t subsribe? I don’t know, but I won’t find out either. Even if there were tons of new sounds regularly, I’d probably still just be interested in a limited few that work best for me. Subscriptions with apps are just greedy. Thus, 3 stars instead of 5 that I would give if it wasn’t for the subscription model.",negative,[]

You can also set how long the app will play or tell it to shut off at a certain time. 

But the best part is, if you don’t pay for the membership (I don’t) it’s still a great app! 100% functional without a paywall. Ads don’t pop up, and are instead a small banner at the bottom. Not obstructive and they don’t make noise. That’s what keeps me loyal to Rain Rain!!",neutral,[]

(Unfortunately insomnia runs in the family) I understand if this was a newly developed app with extra additions such as sleep journal, guided meditation, etc like that, but the developer literally changed nothing. Sad to see this app go due to greed.",negative,[]

7346,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,10/06/2021,Soft wind,I enjoy listen to it,positive,[]
7347,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Canada,30/05/2021,Helpful. (Please read),"My experience has been great. I see no errors and I am OK with the premium, though I don’t plan to buy it as the original noises are fine. 
I haven’t seen many apps that give you a free premium sound (day or night), I think it is cool that you included that. I also like when you leave it on a free premium noise, the next day it will rotate to the new free premium sound so you don’t have to change it.

I have high anxiety in the dark and the calming music keeps me at a calm state. It blocks out noises from my house, just normal noises, like fans running the floors squeaking slightly and outside noise that makes my heart pound.

I have an overreacting mind, I hear the slightest noise and I instantly hide under my blankets, or plug my ears and close my eyes. RainRain not only blocks out the noises but makes me too tired to think about the noises around me.

I use RainRain when I’m reading, angry, or stressed out about something or I just listen to it when I have nothing to do and just want to nap. When I play “Chill Beats” quietly it makes me recap a lot of things that has happened years ago. Which I enjoy seeing memories ??.

My brother and my father snore, it is very loud and bothersome. Thank you to RainRain I can’t hear them snore anymore!

I love that you can change the volume on the sounds, soften their noise, and slow down the speed of the noises so it is at your own liking.

It is sweet that you can turn off your device and RainRain still plays the noises and doesn’t take much battery unless you’re on an older device.

I’ve seen a lot of ratings saying “thunder isn’t calming! ??”. If it isn’t for you don’t listen to it, there are many other choices. It doesn’t make sense for you to just be mad about that one thing and not think about the other good sounds! I for one find thunder calming as it reminds me of when I stayed inside during a storm with the fireplace and blankets playing a board game with my family.

My brother has troubles sleeping sometimes and uses this app too.

The fade out timer is great too. I love it because it is not playing all night and fades out when I’m asleep usually.

Dear developer, I agree with a rating I saw. Owl hoots would be a calming sound if the “Night Mississippi” soundtrack was somehow in it too? 

If you read this far thanks! Please consider downloading this app, as it has taken a great effect on me!

But not having thunder is a huge problem for me. For years I have put thunderstorms on YouTube to help me sleep. With the stupid ads on YouTube, it no longer functions well as a sleep aid. The forest, river, and other noises just don’t do it for me. My best sleep is always in a good thunderstorm and I thought an app like Rain Rain would provide it.

Now, of course the best sounds are found in the premium version, but at least this one is worth buying. It’s quite affordable too!  Easy to mix & match to make your own sounds, name them, and file them away so they are at your fingertips when you’re ready to listen!  
I simply can’t say enough about the genuine sounds you’ll find here, and the simple ease when you’re using this app.  It’s hands down The Very Best Available!",positive,[]

7382,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,14/04/2021,By far my favorite sleep app.,"I have tried numerous apps out there that just weren’t my favorite, until I found rain rain. I decided to give this a try and instantly fell in love. I love that you can mix sounds even without having to pay for subscriptions!

Some times my anxiety gets worse some days than others and it keeps me up at night with my head spiralling around in negative thoughts. But this has helped me to cut out the night lights, turn off the phone, and sleep in total darkness and peace. When I’m on my tough days, I just put on one of the free classical music mixed in with the cicadas. 

I have this app installed on my iPad and normally keep it connected to my speaker. That way I don’t miss my alarm. ?? download this app though if you have bad anxiety/stress like me. It helps!",positive,[]

7469,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,20/01/2021,Pretty good!,"I’d say the app is pretty good. I’m still a student so getting sleep is pretty important for me and normally I’d go to bed at 9pm and toss and turn until around 11pm only to have to wake up at 6am. My mom recommended I get an app like this and I’ve been using it for a few days. It’s pretty good and can get me to sleep at about 10pm or so, the fact that you have to get premium for some noises it’s kinda sucky but understandable..., and I even use it when I just need to calm down and collect myself after a stressful day. Over I’d say it’s a good app. My favorites to listen to are Blizzard Wind/Crackling Fire and Car In The Rain/Chill Beats 1/Chill Beats 3.",positive,[]
7470,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Canada,20/01/2021,Helpful. (Please read),"My experience has been great. I see no errors and I’m OK with the premium, though I don’t plan to buy it as the original noises are fine. 
I haven’t seen many apps that give you a free premium item (day or night), I think it’s cool that you included that. I also like how when you leave it on a premium noise it will rotate to the new free premium sound so you don’t have to do it.

I have high anxiety in the dark and the calming music calms me down. It blocks out noises from my house, just normal noises that make my heart pound but it’s nothing to worry about.

I have an overreacting mind, I hear the slightest noise and I instantly hide under my blankets, RainRain not only blocks out the noises but makes me to tired to think about it.

I use RainRain when I’m reading, angry, or stressed about something or I just play it when I have nothing to do. Somehow when I play chill beats quietly it makes me recap a lot of things that has happened years ago. Which I enjoy seeing memories ??.

My brother and my father snore. Thanks to RainRain I can’t hear them anymore!

I love the fact that you can change the volume on the sounds, soften their noise, and slow down the speed of the noises. 

You can also turn off your device and RainRain still plays and doesn’t take much battery unless you’re on an older device.

I’ve seen a lot of ratings saying “thunder isn’t calming! ??”. If it isn’t for you don’t listen to it, there are many other choices and it doesn’t make sense for you to just be mad about that one thing and not think about the other good sounds! I for one find thunder calming as it reminds me of when I stayed inside during a storm with the fireplace and blankets playing a board game with my family. Also soften the noise! Make the volume quieter!

My brother has troubles sleeping sometimes and uses this app too!

The fade out timer is great too!

Dear developer, I agree with a rating I saw. Owl hoots would be a calming sound if the night Mississippi soundtrack was somehow in it too?

7515,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Germany,22/12/2020,"Fine App, Totally Lacking Privacy","I’m a heavy user of this app, but be warned it does a massive amount of tracking. I added a PiHole DNS server to my network and if I let this app run overnight it attempts to send data to Facebook about 7000 times. 

Who knows what it’s trying to give Facebook, there’s nowhere in the app or the store page where you can find that out. Similarly beyond DNS/firewall level blocks there’s no way to prevent this privacy invasion. 

This might not even be the only tracking the app does. Any app that wants to phone home to Facebook 7000 times in a single night is surely integrating other data mining SDKs. Until the developer issues an update allowing some level of privacy I would not recommend anyone use this app.",negative,[]

So I find it and get it in my phone, thinking to myself how nice I would sleep tonight with this app! This must have been a fan for the Hoover Dam it was so bold and loud.

Not all sounds in the app are free, but the ones that are, are pretty high quality so far. Thank you to the developer for that.

The some downsides for me are that the sleep timer only has preset options (end at a specific time, or at the minimum of 15 min), but this isn't too big if an issue. The timer also, starts immediately after choosing duration - no setting it before and then just pressing play and having it play for that duration.",mixed,[]

Now I almost feel I can’t sleep without it. Little features really set it apart from other similar apps, like being able to mix different sounds to keep a little bit of variety going. However there is one issue that seems to negatively impact the usefulness of it. I’m a very light sleeper so I have to set the volume pretty low in order to not be kept awake by the sound. But sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and the volume from the app is much higher than I set it at when I went to sleep. Or sometimes I wake up in the morning and I can tell that I didn’t sleep very well, and the volume is too low to hear it. There seems to be a glitch that causes it to change the volume sporadically. If it wasn’t for that, I would give it five stars. Also one feature I’d recommend, give the app a Fade IN timer so you can set it to turn ON after a set period of time, that would make it so much better, then I wouldnt have to set the volume so low and risk it not being loud enough to work while I’m asleep.",positive,[]

I love you can switch up and mix together sounds. One of my favorites is train, rain, and bird sounds. That’s not something you can find anywhere else but you can make your own personal lullaby and if that changes by the day, you can change it up. Every since I started using this four years ago, it has changed my life for the better. I have anxiety and get panic attacks in the middle of the night sometimes, but whenever I feel something coming on, I put on my little mix and the world seems right again. Thank you.",positive,[]
7569,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,12/11/2020,Wish I could give it five stars,"I seriously love this app. I can usually fall asleep, but I have trouble staying asleep or getting deep quality sleep, and this app has really helped me improve that. Now I almost feel I can’t sleep without it. Little features really set it apart from other similar apps, like being able to mix different sounds to keep a little bit of variety going. However there is one issue that seems to negatively impact the usefulness of it. I’m a very light sleeper so I have to set the volume pretty low in order to not be kept awake by the sound. But sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and the volume from the app is much higher than I set it at when I went to sleep. Or sometimes I wake up in the morning and I can tell that I didn’t sleep very well, and the volume is too low to hear it. There seems to be a glitch that causes it to change the volume sporadically. If it wasn’t for that, I would give it five stars.",positive,[]

7572,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Netherlands,11/11/2020,Great app for sleeping/tinnitus,"I’ve been using this app for a while now, and I dare say I use it at least 5 times a week. I suffer from tinnitus which can be maddening, especially when it’s quiet at night. Therefore I almost always use this app. 
There are very many sounds to choose from, there’s something for everyone. I usually go for the classic rain/thunderstorm or brown noise. There is even a toggle to ‘soften’ the sound (make it less or more ‘harsh’ as it were) and a toggle to have the sound oscillate (have the sound go up and down in volume).
The timer function makes it super easy to choose how long the sound goes on for; I usually pick about an hour to go to sleep before it fades out. On bad nights I make it two hours just to be sure.
Lastly, you can mix sounds as well and save your favorite mixes!

I honestly never write app reviews, but this app has made a big difference to me and I simply really appreciate whoever made it.",neutral,[]

My bank account is a chaotic mess of recurring subscriptions that I am slowly eliminating.

In addition to many of their free sounds, you get free meditations, sleep exercises, zen music, stories & much more. They have never crashed on me. Sorry Rain Rain, but those are the facts. If you can get your ball rolling then perhaps.. but I’m off to ‘Relax Melodies’.",neutral,[]

I've downloaded apps like these, but yet this one isn't even as AMAZING as this!! 

I would always write a section with the problems, but yet I can't find a SINGLE problem in this! So instead I'll write what is amazing and perfect about this app!

1). The sounds are in the background!! So apps that I've downloaded before weren't background sounds, which was a problem for me. But this HAS, I mean HAS sounds in the background!

2). The timer and the alarm(alarm for when your bedtime)! Omg! The timer and alarm is great! Although, this isn't a big problem/issue but can you edit the timer? So like it's however long you want it? 

3). Again, with the other apps I've downloaded, the sounds aren't that great AND the other sounds you have to pay money for. This app isn't like those apps! There is a TON of sounds!! Just amazing sounds! 

4). Making mixes are easy! With one app that was like this, it was soo hard to create mixes, I couldn't even figure it out. But here it's just a few taps and BOOM ?? you have a mix! 

There is soo many more awesome things about this app, that it would be to many to even list! Thank you for you time! ???? I couldn't ask for a better app! ??????????

This app needs to be rated 5??, it DESERVES it!!",positive,[]

Whether you're using this app for free, willing to buy a few premium sounds, or subscribing to the premium version, it's all worth it.

The different purchases available feel more like ways to support the app and developer than a throttling of features to get you to pay while still pretending to be free. Prices are fair and the quality of the sounds is worth every penny. The majority of sounds when using this app are free, and for those you don't have you can either buy certain sounds a la carte, or subscribe to unlock them all.

7697,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Saudi Arabia,27/07/2020,Rain sounds while you sleep!,"Nice app for playing soothing rain sounds to fall asleep to. It’s quite effective in drowning out noises in the room for a long peaceful sleep. It has a handy feature that allows fading out the sound after a set time. This will stop the sound after you’ve fallen asleep, saving phone battery for the rest of the night. The app has various kinds of rain sounds, which you can mix together to create the optimal ambience you want. The mix I use is Rain Downpour, Rain Dripping, and Slow Stream. The sound of each volume can be individually controlled. There are ads, which are not annoying at all, and which can easily be removed by making a purchase, like I did.

Perhaps the best thing is that you can control the sounds from the lock screen. I find this very convenient.

I’ve been using this app daily for years. I’ve tried several other apps in the Store, but I’ve found this one to be quite the best. Highly recommended.",positive,[]

3. Also maybe add so you can stack more then three nosies together?
4. As long as I keep my phone off while listening to the relaxing sounds my battery doesn’t go down!

7731,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,06/07/2020,Saved My Life,"I honestly don’t know what I would do without this app. It has literally saved me. I have a neighbor upstairs who is heavy-footed. He stomps around constantly, into the wee hours of the night, so sleep is impossible. With this app, I can configure the perfect combination of rain and thunder to effectively drown him out. It has literally saved my sanity. When I hear him, I just put in my noise-cancelling headphones and turn on this app, and I can feel the stress slowly fade away with the sound of rain drops.

Jag vaknade mitt i natten av att regnljudet jag somnat till fortfarande var i full gång, på en väldigt hög volym. Min nyvakna hjärna blev förvirrad och försökte då lokalisera vart ljudet kom ifrån. Av någon anledning trodde den då att det jag hörde var ljudet kom från någon av min familjs eltandborstar, så därför tog jag mig in a badrummet, där det var helt nedsläckt.

I also really like that the screen doesn’t have to be on for it to play making it perfect for overnight sleeping sounds with the phone locked and screen off. Overall great app!

It’s very faint but when I listen to it closely with my earbuds in and with my eyes closed, I hear it and it’s super bothersome. But if you don’t hear it, good.

I’m editing this: I sent u my suggestion for a noise but it said “document failed try again” I tried and tried but it wouldn’t let me send it ?????. So I thought about owl hooting calmly in the night (not premium please!) and sheep baas. Because if u were to soften the baas it would sound nice.

I sent an email and got an immediate response that moved the app back to token and gave me several free tokens as well. What a relief, since I only really use one sound (love the wind with leaves), so I don't need the monthly subscription.

This is BY FAR the best white noise app (i've tried several) and has the best service too. Highly recommend!!",neutral,[]

7771,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,United Kingdom,08/06/2020,Actually really good,I usually don’t leave reviews o apps but this one is actually quite good.

Not only is it free (have to pay for some extras), but they have different noise options that you can combine to have play at the same time. You can save your combinations and any noises you like for quick access, and the noises keep playing when you turn your phone screen off!

Some times my anxiety gets worse some days than others and it keeps me up at night with my head spiralling around in negative thoughts. But this has helped me to cut out the night lights, turn off the phone, and sleep in total darkness and peace. When I’m on my tough days, I just put on one of the free classical music mixed in with the cicadas.

It is readily apparent the app was designed with care. I downloaded it because I missed the rain. But I use it almost daily for multiple purposes, rain or shine. The original rain rain sound is a full-bodied downpour with a rumbling thunderstorm which in addition to being amazing to listen to, will quickly calm even the fiercest of emotions or tune out the noisiest co-workers to allow focus during the workday. Some rain sounds are hard and staccato (like “rain on a car”, having the effect of harnessing and redirecting excessive alertness; while the softer rain and nature sounds are gently soothing and can be great for sleep. There are watery sounds, dry sounds, windy sounds and gentle machine sounds like a dryer and a clock.

7821,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,16/05/2020,Not Controllable,"I have an iPhone running the latest iOS 13 software. First of all, I think it’s ridiculous to PAY for sound you can literally find for free. But my problem with this app is the simple fact it can’t be controlled. I’ll have this app COMPLETELY closed, and not even running in the background or pulled up. And it will literally turn itself on and start making noise: Without me interacting with the app. Or if my phone gets connected to a Bluetooth device, it’s like the app automatically launches on its own and begins playing sounds. So if you enjoy not being able to control your apps, then this is the one for you! But if you’re like me, and get tired of your phone making random noises all throughout the day and bloody night: you’re not going to have a good time. I’ve literally never seen an app that had a will of its own.",negative,[]
7822,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Australia,16/05/2020,Best app if you have a baby!!!,"I started using this app myself a few years ago there is nothing that I loved more then falling asleep to the sound of a thunderstorm. 
I had my first child 12 weeks ago and noticed that lullabies did nothing to help settle him at night I had never previously ventured away from my favorite “thunderstorm” sound but as I scrolled down the page I found the ‘white noise’ section and what a life saver that is!

7824,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,15/05/2020,Rain Rain vs Calm,"I had Calm for over a year and my go to sleep sound was rain and thunderstorms. However about 2 months ago when the Covid 19 started AND Calm started advertising on every tv channel, the app no longer let me search for rain or thunderstorms. Yet When I scrolled available/recommended sounds on Calm, every rain and thunderstorm sounds cost money,I had to pay. I deleted and downloaded and signed up again and with another email and it still didn’t allow me a free rain and thunderstorm sounds.

I’ve been listening to RAIN RAIN and it’s working great! Sounds are awesome and realistic, no high low fluctuations in volume. Also listen to Amazon Prime music for rain and thunderstorms on my tv but they only last for 1 minute to 5 minutes. Not continually like RAIN RAIN. 

Love RAIN RAIN! The very best so far!!!",neutral,[]

Not all sounds in the app are free, but the ones that are, are pretty high quality so far. Thank you to the developer for that.

The some downsides for me are that the sleep timer isn’t fully customizable, as in the minimal amount of time for the sound(s) to play is 15 min, what if I only need 1 min. The timer also, starts immediately after choosing duration - no setting it before and then just pressing play, but still have it play to that duration.",mixed,"[""Audio"", ""Satisfied users""]"

Every night I plug in my under-pillow speaker, turn on Rain Rain, and awake to the morning lighting up the forest through my window.  So 10 years ago I contacted a fungal disease which wiped me out making sleep something I no longer did. I would put a book-on-tape playing just to fill the space in my mind, taking it off “I’m not sleeping”, but I would continue to wake up with the book rattling on. A friend suggested white noise, I tried a couple apps but the sounds were tin-like and repetitive, not soothing. I decided to try one more, which turned out being Rain Rain.

7960,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,26/02/2020,"Create your own mixes, like “Pullman Car”","The sounds are clean, clear and perfect. They must be on l-o-n-g loops because I’ve never noticed a repetition. I particularly like Rain Rain’s customizing features. For example, I wanted the rhythmic sound of a Pullman sleeping car on an old-fashioned train, but I found Rain Rain’s “Train” sound a bit too modern for me — too light on the rhythmic, clickity-clack of an old train — and the train’s whistle blew a crossing signal too loudly and too often. So, I mixed “Train” with “Washing Machine,” softened both, cut the volume of “Train” a bit, and put “Train” on the slowest oscillate. The result, which I named “Pullman Car,” makes it sound to me like I’m in a sleeping car several cars behind an old engine and with far fewer and softer crossing signals from the whistle. My favorite mix — puts me to sleep in a few minutes. 
     This is a truly great app with SUPER-well-thought-out features. Rain Rain deserves maximum stars for sure — I’d give it 10, if I could. Thanks a whole lot, Tim!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Satisfied users""]"

But, most of the apps options are premium. This is sad, considering that some of those options could help certain people go to sleep. And your timer. I got 2 things. 1: the timer sometimes goes past the time we set it to, or pushes the time back! 2: It might be helpful if on the timer dock, you could have an (optional) alarm.

Otherwise, the app is amazing. It has lots of natural sounds that put people to sleep. They did a good job making the app Rain Rain.

When my audiologist suggested I listen to a soothing background noise or white noise.

8028,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,25/01/2020,"Create your own mixes, like “Pullman Car”","The sounds are clean, clear and perfect. They must be on l-o-n-g loops because I’ve never noticed a repetition. I particularly like Rain Rain’s customizing features. For example, I wanted the rhythmic sound of a Pullman sleeping car on an old-fashioned train, but I found Rain Rain’s “Train” sound too modern —too light on the rhythmic sound of an old chug-chug locomotive, and the train whistle blew a crossing signal too loudly and too often for me. So, I mixed “Train” with “Washing Machine,” softened both, cut the volume of “Train” a bit, and put the “Train” half on slowest oscillate. The result, which I named “Pullman Car,” makes it sound to me like I’m in a sleeping car several cars behind an old engine and with far fewer and softer crossing signals from the train whistle. My favorite mix — puts me to sleep in a few minutes. 
     This is a truly great app with SUPER-well-thought-out features. Rain Rain deserves maximum stars for sure — I’d give it 10, if I could. Thanks a whole lot, Tim!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Satisfied users""]"

8065,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Australia,06/01/2020,I think I’m addicted,"This app is WONDERFUL! It’s solved almost all my sleeping issues, I just pick my favourite rain, set my alarm, and within 2 minutes I’m asleep! Even on public transport all I have to do to nap in such a busy space is pop my earphones in with Rain Rain and close my eyes. Only problem is I might be addicted? I don’t like falling asleep without the app now - but it’s much better than tossing and turning without it! (I joke of course, this app has only done good things for me)

Thank you for making this app so accessible, with so many free options and different options if you’d like to support the app a little more and pay for extras. The new way of paying is much better than the old ‘packs’ (of which I bought the Winter one for one sound I really liked).

Not so with Rain Rain — I’m so impressed by how robust (and well-considered) the sounds are, especially the thunder and many rain sounds available. Thunder in particular seems hard to get right, but here it sounds as if there’s a storm right outside my window to lull me to sleep.

Also, that so many high quality sounds are available free with the app is wonderful.

For example, I wanted the rhythmic sound of a Pullman sleeping car, but I found Rain Rain’s “Train” sound too light on the rhythmic rail sound, and the train whistle blew a crossing signal too loudly and too often for me. So, I mixed “Train” with “Washing Machine,” softened both, cut the volume of “Train” a bit, and put the “Train” half on slowest oscillate. The result, which I named “Pullman Car,” makes it sound to me like I’m in a sleeping car 10 or more cars behind the engine and with far fewer and softer crossing signals from the train whistle. My favorite mix — puts me to sleep in a few minutes. This is a truly great app with SUPER-well-thought-out features. Rain Rain deserves maximum stars for sure — I’d give it 10, if I could.

You should read this before you download!!

Hi,
This app is WONDERFUL except with the iPhone 6s+ and lower only. The problem is whenever you leave your phone on with “Auto Sleep Mode” with whatever settings you have set up (also with “never”) the rain will shut off. This only happens when you have multiple rains/music/sounds. Though, it doesn’t shut off when you shut off your phone by your self. 

Please try to fix this!

The result , whuch I named “Pullman Car,” makes it sound like I’m in a sleeping car 10 or 12 cars behind the engine and with far fewer crossing signals from the train whistle. My favorite mix.

A friend told me about an app that provided background sounds to help ease me into sleep. HA! I scoffed! But decided to give it a try! People were beginning to comment on dark circles, asking if I was ill, etc so OK I’ll give it a try! So I did! After trying SEVERAL different apps I found the ONE that offers the MOST VARIETY for the BEST PRICE! Rain, Rain really does the trick for me!! I soon remembered how well I always slept with my window open during a summer thunderstorm!! Most of these apps offer a basic set of sounds & functions free with additional sounds & functions at an additional cost or yearly fee, as does this app BUT the basic offerings are outstanding and better than the others I tried. Offered free is a wide variety of sounds including water sounds, weather, animals, people/places, music and a featured Premium sound every day PLUS night mode, go to bed reminder, fade out timer and MORE!! I MAY go premium at some point as the cost is very reasonable but for now I am DELIGHTED with the app as is! I haven’t even listened to HALF the sounds/music offered!

8231,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,15/10/2019,Amazing. The Highest Quality App on My Phone.,"I have been using Rain Rain for almost 3 years, and I have always loved it so much. All the sounds feel so real and high quality, and I never hear them loop, so it truly feels like they are there. If you are someone who likes having a certain noise on while sleeping, there is so much more than just rain sounds. There are fire cracking, trains, animal noises, air vents, all sorts of random things that all come together for anyone who is into that sort of thing. Another thing to mention is there are NO ADS. This is such an amazing gift of this app, I can’t tell you how many times i’ve gotten home, been tired as all hell, and just laid down, opened the app up, and started playing my sounds and just passed out. If there were ads, I would have to awkwardly wait while an ad plays during the middle of the night, which would be the worst when you just want to go to sleep. The user interface is truly stellar. The app automatically sets the sounds you had selected last, so all you have to do is just hit a button and sleep! Not to mention you can pick 3 sounds at a time. I love this, certain sounds mix so well it feels like you’re really there. I also really love how premium sounds work. You get one premium sound a day, or you can purchase them. I love this, as I like the surprise of some nights before bed getting on and being excited for what new sound i’ll get. You can also sample any sound before you buy it, so you know if you want it. I think this really shows how this app genuinely cares for your sleep, not just to make money. I am all for this, as I find myself constantly questioning every company and whatever they provide, always asking myself, “Where’s the catch?” Well, i’m happy to say that in Rain Rain, there is no catch. It’s just pure, 100% sounds. I’m going to continue to use this app for as long as I can, and I hope to whoever is reading this, that you can find as much enjoyment in this app that I have over the years. I am so happy to have this in my life!",neutral,"[""Advertising"", ""Audio"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]"

8240,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,05/10/2019,Formerly great app.  FORMERLY.,"This app was amazing but I can no longer recommend it.

In my particular case, I was using the app as a continuous background noise generator on an otherwise retired old iPhone, (battery life has gone on it, thanks a lot Apple for THAT...) , but since updating to iOS 13, the app no longer plays continuously, shutting down after playing for a while.

This happens even when the phone itself has NO other apps open, is NOT disturbed or interrupted by anything, NOT even TOUCHED, in fact, (being in airplane mode w/ notifications, WiFi and BT all turned OFF,) and connected to an Apple charger plugged in to an AC outlet by an Apple Lightning cable.

Sadly, I had to switch to something ELSE to be my continuous wooshing-noise source.  :(",negative,"[""Battery"", ""Connectivity"", ""Gaming"", ""Notifications & Alerts"", ""Devices""]"

I also love that the timer automatically applies the last used setting so that I don’t forget to set it every night - because I WILL sleep through my alarm otherwise. I also love that it’s not contingent on any data usage - I fly a lot and I definitely appreciate having my sounds in the sky. Thank you to the app developer for the sounds that help me sleep!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]"

I safely stopped using them, but, sleep is elusive.  Before I found Rain Rain I had tried a number of other sleep sounds apps or Pandora.  Music is great, but I tended to listen to the music rather than sleeping. Other sleep app sounds were mostly variations on a theme of static.  Rain Rain sounds real. My favorite water sounds are soothing.  What I enjoy the most about Rain Rain is the variety of choices of sounds to pick from!  I have lots of great choices for the most appropriate sounds for me.  Listening to only one sound every night tends to irritate the part of my brain that needs to be calmed.  Because I have so many choices, I don’t have to lay awake listening to the same thing night after night.  
My sleep is still elusive, but, I can at least enjoy the sounds and make up stories to go with the sounds, which seemed to work when I was an insomniac kid.",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Satisfied users""]"

But that doesn’t really bother me that much.

8408,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,05/07/2019,Worth buying but it's free,"Generous number of free sounds with a sampling of other libraries you will like. Good quality. Easy to use. The new oscillate feature lets any track fade in and out for more natural variety.

I got this originally to use the fireplace sound for reading. And I love rain, so now I play this instead of music in the background.

You can also play music first in another app and then add the Rain Rain sounds to it. Every night a different playlist with your breezy ocean.

The most fun thing is you can mix several sounds to recreate that camping trip in comfort or your vacation at the shore or even your old apartment in the city. 

Sleep you hardly think about until you can't find it. It's loss affects everything all next day. And then being very tired can make rest even harder to reach.

Now for many nights I went between the different apps, trying to find something that fit everything I wanted, specifically to customize the sound I wanted. No other app did but Rain Rain. And, best of all, it’s free!

I have been using it every single night for four years STRAIGHT. Every update to the app has gotten better, now being able to customize so much more to make sure your sound perfect. I can’t recommend this app enough. The developer really cares about the app and you can tell how much love is poured into it!!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]"

I am still LOVING this app! It’s just fantastic! My babies are now growing and they love the rain app to fall asleep to! During the day when any of my daughters want a sleep they will actually find their iPads go to their room and put the rain app on and have a nap. It’s just great! You’ve done an amazing job!! 
I truly love this app! I've been using it for a long time! It's great!! It's helped me with my last 2 babies and settling them when they've had a bad night! It's helped me get a lot more sleep! I love it!!!!",positive,"[""Satisfied users"", ""Devices""]"
8474,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Australia,14/06/2019,????????????,"Six Stars! ????????????

There! The developer’s wish come true ??

I’ve used Rain Rain App for a long time & loved falling asleep to the sounds of rain. There are many different sounds both free & premium that I’ve favourited.  My absolute favourite is ‘Car in the Rain’.

I use a few different rain sound apps & always keep coming back to this one!

This App was already five stars in my mind but I had one slight issue - I’m sensitive to high frequency sounds. This was common across all apps so I never made mention of it until now. 

The latest update today included a slider to filter out high frequencies! This feature alone added the sixth star! Another new feature I’ll make use of is the ‘Suggest a Sound’. I’ll take my time because there’s already a terrific list to choose from.

I’m not a fan of subscription services but I’m very happy the developer has included both one-off payments, as well as subscription services, to satisfy everyone’s payment styles & listening choices. There are enough quality free sounds, supported by small ads appearing at the bottom of the app, to satisfy anyone who’s on a tight budget. Add a few relatively cheap premium sounds & you’ve got a very good selection.

I highly recommend this app. Its in active development & the developer is committed to refining a very polished product.

8481,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Australia,12/06/2019,Great app but a premium version would be nice!,"Great app so far! You can have the app on in the background while you play music and adjust the levels to get that perfect rainy mood, as well as pick, choose and mix sounds. The app has adjustable timers but otherwise continues playing with no audio ads with pretty minimal battery usage. Boasts a huge range of not just rain sounds, but ambient noises like cafes, summer ambience, chimes and more.

My only grievance is the premium tokens and subscription-based premium content. I’d much rather pay for a premium version of the app with all the sounds unlocked once than either pay for tokens separately or on a monthly subscription ($6 p/m). Can’t say I enjoy this new trend of subscription-based apps and programs where the program/app will never strictly belong to you.

Otherwise a great app!",neutral,"[""Advertising"", ""Audio"", ""Battery"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update"", ""Use cases""]"

Great for falling asleep to or for guided meditation or just as background noise when reading, I have been using this app over other sleep/meditation apps or YouTube rain sounds for a few months now because of it’s variety & sleep timer.

Really high quality & no fake computer generated sounding ones which I hate. Also it doesn’t have loads of crazy bird noises or chimes that you sometimes find on things like this, that frighten the life out of you just as you’re nodding off.

Sleep apnea is simple to treat with a Cpap, but insomnia is not easy at all, not even with sleep medications.  To make a long story short, I have tried everything to experience the luxury of a sound, deep, rejovenating sleep.  Then I discovered Rain Rain.  

The first night I used the app, I slept 7 hours of uninterrupted, restorative sleep.  I awakened to a sun-filled room and for a moment I was completely disoriented; my form of insomnia not only prevents me from falling asleep, it also awakens me three or four times a night -- always to a dark room.  Sometimes I an able to return to sleep; other times that is impossible.  

By the way, I love this new version; the software runs perfectly, and I absolutely love the ""soften” option which I use it to soften the sound  of thunder for every rain sequence I play; because rain is not rain without a pinch of rumbling, distant thunder. 

 Using Rain Rain has made it possible to sleep like a normal person again.  Even more importantly, various unrelated  health issues have also improved because I now am able to experience 7 or 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.   And I can remember my dreams again!

The included free sounds are good, but now I have almost all of the mini premium packages, too, with only 3 remaining.

It’s incredible to have hooked up to speakers or bluetooth and I’ve always been able to get music to play simultaneously.

He even configured the images to show correctly on the now playing lock screen when there are multiple sounds playing.

But sometimes too many details. Buttons are a little small. Maybe make the sounds mixer horizontally scrollable rather than fitting all 3 into the screen width.

Make bottom portion bigger (where the volume controls and stuff are) so the buttons can be bigger and more breathing room. I think I’d be okay with less room for the sounds list table view.",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Design & UX"", ""Satisfied users""]"
8605,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,04/04/2019,Helped my Anxiety.,"I’ve been using this app for over 2 years now. It started because some nights I felt anxious and just needed something to listen to to calm me down. Then I fell even more in love with it when they added train sounds. I lived in an apartment right by a train and when I would go to my parents for a night or two it was a nice reminder of my home. Now I use it every night, regardless of anxiety (even though it still really helps with that!) Recently it’s gotten some great updates that make the user face easier, and the ability to play multiple sounds at once is awesome! 

Sometimes I use it during the day too, mixed with my music that you can play after you’ve started up the rain rain sounds on any music app. Use it to give a cozy vibe to a fall day, or give me calm vibes during stressful times. 

There is a paid version, but I don’t use that because I don’t feel I need to. It has enough at its core, the add ons are just that, extra! They are not needed and the app doesn’t shove it down your throat. I also noticed I had some free premium currency I have yet to use, and might some time. 

I wish there was a better night light mode, I’m not sure how it could be improved but it hasn’t done anything special for me and it’s a cool idea, but I just don’t think it’s implemented that well. 

So thank you developers! Please keep supporting this app or I may never be able to sleep again!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update"", ""Use cases""]"

I was checking this app out last night and thought I’d turned it off and went to bed. When I woke up this morning my husband told me that I must have slept really good because unlike most nights I didn’t move around all night. He told me that I’d slept like a log and hadn’t woke him up once by tossing and turning like I always do. I didn’t think anything else about it. I got up, made coffee and got myself a bite to eat and ran to the store and came back in my bedroom to watch one of my favorite daily shows, but I fell right back to sleep. I just felt like I needed more sleep, I fell back asleep and then when I woke up I asked myself what is wrong with you girl? It’s almost 2:00 o’clock! Then I seen that my phone was right under the edge of my pillow, When I picked it up I HEARD MY RAIN ON A WINDOW PLAYING. Lol ! No wonder I’d felt sleepy all morning! My sleeping pill was turned on LOL..!! No doubt! This App works great! A little too great, Right? Rain on a window, on a tent and one other are so great. I only wish that Rain on a ten roof, would really sound like Rain on a ten roof, but it sounds like Rain on pop cans. I really really really wish this app was fixed on that one... I wish there was RAIN ON A LAKE, & Rain with wind but no thunder. But I know everyone is different and I do LOVE THIS APP. You guys might wanna add a fan since a lot of us love that sound as well. ..

The apps great variety of sounds really help, depending on how bad my tinnitus is on that particular day. If I’ve got three or more noises going, I find mixing some of the Rain Rain noises really drowns it out and gives me something to fix on.

I almost never update these types of app because with every update you get less than before while they try and make you pay for what you used to get for free. In this version 6.0 they made some previously free sounds so that you had to use points to unlock it. It’s really sad because this used to be such a great free app. I’m only using this still because my previously favorite sounds haven’t gone ‘premium’ yet.

I use to have issues with falling asleep but it’s turned into a nightly routine that puts me to sleep within seven minutes. If I happen to wake up during the night, my Bluetooth speaker continues to play while my phone charges. I do sometimes use a timer but I find I always end up turning the sound back on throughout the night. 

This app is also really good for travel, drowning out the noise of the plane or your friends snoring in the same room ??

My favorite feature? It will play in the background while I read in a different app to fall asleep (even the free version!!). I don’t have to re-engage my brain & wake myself up more to switch apps & find my sound. I just fall asleep.

With the new premium sounds I would like to listen to them mixed with free sounds before purchasing them with the coins, so maybe you can add that as a feature. Also I think you should make a way to earn coins. Like sharing with 10 or so people can earn you one coin, Or ideas like that

I really love this app, it helps me sleep quicker and calms me down, The only thing I would want to change for sure is being able to mix the premium sound with another to test it before purchasing. 

This is my favorite sleep sound app and I hope it continues to prove and surprise me even more with each upcoming change!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]"

I power up the app, put in ear buds, and the next thing I know, we’ve arrived at our destination. I was knocked out, like so deep in sleep that apparently my head was swinging around and hitting the seat but I didn’t feel a thing. Since then, this app has been with me through everything. Nights that I have trouble falling asleep, plane rides, bus rides, car rides, college dorms & college roommates, snoring parents, group trips, etc etc. Absolutely any time I need to tune out the world and fall asleep right away, I use Rain Rain.

I’ve had to delete the app a couple times, then reinstall it because I was driving and trying to use my phones navigation, and I couldn’t hear the directions because the app somehow opened itself up and was playing over the navigation system.

8796,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,16/01/2019,Volume and price,"Not bad, but really need external speakers for this. Too loud for the phone speakers on most models.

And third. A monthly subscription? Again? You know this is mostly automatic and doesn’t cost any where near the price they are asking. This is one time purchase app only. Shouldn’t make you pay a monthly fee ever. Market is over flooded with apps you may or may not use much, that rips you off by making you pay way over the actual price, but makes it LOOK cheap by offering that one low cost, that you pay monthly.

There is even cricket and cicadas sounds. Those personally get to me before too long but, if you like that, you’ll love this app. The free features are great on their own but, I like to support the developers out there that don’t give the impression that they only want money. i.e. most other apps similar to this one want money right away to get the best features. Not this one! It is very affordable if you decide to purchase some extras. So, I will be purchasing a couple of the sound packs. I look forward to see if new sounds are added. I would really love the sound of a light wind with rustling trees. It reminds me of camping when I was a kid. Which by the way, the app also has rain on a tent. Get this app!

8848,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,United Kingdom,01/01/2019,All round good.,"I don’t usually leave feedback but seeing that I use this app on a day to day basis I thought I might. 

I use rain rain to help me drift to sleep. I like that there is a timer which I usually set for 15 minutes (usually does the job  zzzz) 

I love that there are different groups ie household noises, birds etc, nature. And that you can mix any noise to create a  personalised sound for yourself. I don’t pay to use rain rain so I usually just play the usual rain pouring down etc. Sometimes I’ll mix it up abit, which I can with  various others (free ones)

You can listen to one paid noise for free each day but they don’t really vary very much, they seem to be the same old ones? I think that’s the only thing I’d like to point out.  Actually also (sorry)..new noises could be updated more regularly??  

Anyways..  I’d like to say thank you to the app peeps for helping me get a peaceful nights sleep ?? keep going with this app, it’s great!

“Rap tap tap. Rap tap tap.” 
Is it something outside? A window rattling in the wind? 
“Rap tap tap. Rap tap tap.”
It seems to repeat every 1 minute or so. Is it the refrigerator or a the water heater or something? 
“Rap tap tap. Rap tap tap.”
 I get up to explore the house. Can’t seem to find it anywhere. Coming back to bed I hear it again. It’s coming from the bedroom! 
“RAP TAP TAP. RAP TAP TAP.“
Turns our this incessant “rap tap tap, rap tap tapping” is coming from the relaxing sounds app! And now that I’ve heard it, it is no longer relaxing, it’s just “rap tap tap, rap tap tapping” that keeps me from falling asleep.

8970,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,United Kingdom,07/11/2018,Highly recommend for soothing sleep!,"I have always been a rubbish sleeper - if I’m stressed I find it hard to drop to sleep & most nights I’m awake at several points at intervals throughout the night. So, I have tried various ‘white noises’ which I always find More disturbing! I wake up & heat it buzzing away. But this app is absolutely wonderful, it creates a realistic, cosy, comforting atmosphere which just relaxes you to your core. There are many lovely settings & sounds to choose from (I personally like the ‘car in the rain’ sound - which is mellow & consistent). Very clever gesture that u can mix your own favourite sounds. Or select your favourites. Love that it can either stay on all night, or you can set a dimmer/timer for however long u want. You need flexibility when something is so ‘individual’ a sleep habit - some nights you’ll want it on all night & other, easy, just switch ur standard timer on or easily set it for your desired time.

9124,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,07/09/2018,Busy mom gets sleep!!!,"I slept so great last night! Thank you  for this app:) I always have slept great when it rains and fairly normal otherwise I think: sometimes ok, sometimes broken, sometimes I wake and can’t go back to sleep ( busy mom, wife, professional).  After 3 nights of restless, broken sleep I crawled in with my daughter (to keep from waking my husband again) who had this app running. I slept until morning and woke from a deep delightful sleep that I was so grateful for!! 
I have now downloaded it on my phone. Finding the sounds that sooth me was easy ( “Thunder cracks” +“Mississippi at night”:) I can’t wait to try it again! Maybe I’ll even get a successful nap in someday. 

Anyhow, if you find yourself wishing for sleep I recommend you download this app, Scroll to find the sound ( or add 2 together for a combo- very user friendly) that relaxes you (you know what it is- you’ll remember when you hear it!), and let it play:)
 I can tell you it’s worth a shot. I took the time to write my first review ever to let you know that I would never have tried this on my own- even after it was suggested to me ( too busy, skeptical) I’m so very glad I had such a great & unexpected experience (Thank you Natalie :))

9173,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,USA,14/08/2018,Best Free App!,"I have had this app for over TWO years and it’s about time I write this review. You have sounds ranging from laundry machine, dripping sink, to thunder storms or rain on a car! All free, choose up to 3 sound combinations and create your own listening mix, you can toggle the volume of each sound to make a unique sleep sound track for yourself. If you like it, save to favorites forever or click the X and choose another sound. There is a premium upgrade where you can pay for additional sounds. The sounds included for free are high quality, looped sounds. You can also set a bedtime reminder or a fade out timer if you’re like me and need white noise to fall asleep. Over the last two years the app has only gotten better and better with each update. I highly recommend to anyone even thinking of going to the store and buying a white noise machine or sleep sound machine to try this app first— you won’t be disappointed!",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]"

It actually sounds realistic and there are beautiful pictures. It is organized and I love some of the features. 

I will say though, it does crash a lot. Which should not happen. I realize this has been happening to other people, and I'm not sure what to do. It will just power my phone off in the middle of the night while playing a sound or close out of the app.

This is one of the only things that has brought me reprieve and even hope that if my condition is to be permanent, I could learn to live with it. It has certainly saved me some sleepless nights.

I noted that the developer claimed this was due to a phone’s “native settings” to another set of feedback reporting the same issue. This is not true. There is no functionality in the settings app to over-ride this behaviour. Other apps such as Spotify and Calm allow background playing. This app behaves like YouTube however where it is only functional when it’s the on-screen app - but while Google intentionally do that to push people towards paying for YouTube premium, I am not sure whether the developers of this app had the same intention with this lack of functionality.",negative,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Devices""]"

12890,ReSound Tinnitus Relief,iOS,USA,01/11/2020,Shame on ReSound For Charging $70/Year!,"You’re already making money hand over fist from people who are suffering with profound hearing loss and severe tinnitus with your way over-priced hearing aids. But now this?? Really? 

Tinnitus can drive some people to suicide, you do know that right? Shame, shame, shame on you for capitalizing even more on people’s suffering. It’s actually sickening. 

Whomever came up with the idea for ReSound to charge $6.99/month or $70/year for an app that *may* give them relief from this maddening symptom of hearing loss is pure evil. 

I paid $4,000 out of pocket for your hearing aids, that drive me insane, that give me reverb every time I try and use a phone and that came with the worst app I’ve ever seen. I wish I had another choice or had known how rotten your company is, but I did not. After ten days of nonstop tinnitus to the point I am losing my mind, losing sleep and cannot concentrate on anything, I came here looking for relief to go with my $4k deluxe air pods only to find you’ll charge me $70/year for something that might not even help. Nice. Real nice. 

All I do know is that I will never purchase any of your products ever again and since this was my first set of HA’s, and I’m quite young, there’s a good chance I will be needing new ones some day. I will bring your company’s ridiculous charges for this app up with my audiologist, my doctor and anyone else who will listen. Pun intended.

13768,T-Minus - Tinnitus Wellness,iOS,United Kingdom,30/06/2020,Five stars! Such relief! Wonderful!,"Do get this App if you have tinnitus like me. Don’t hesitate. The sound quality and the range of sounds and the ability to tailor them with white or pink or brown noise etc plus a frequency pitch you can adjust are superb. It’s so much better than the generic Rain and Storms or Trickling Streams plus Beauty Spa music or White Noise type albums that you can buy or find on YouTube.  It’s a comfort to me to know I have this App on my phone and can turn to it when my tinnitus gets annoying or if it interrupts my sleep. My particular favourites are “Priory Bay”, “Water”, “Cuban Cafe” and “Magestic” and I select low pink noise with these which I prefer to white noise and then add a frequency pitch just slightly deeper than the one that I can hear sometimes in my head. I’m pretty clueless with technology but the App is so easy to use and clearly labelled. It’s really nice to look at too. Clean and uncluttered with lovely images. Someone has put a lot of thought into the look of this not just the excellence of the sounds and what the App can do. Can’t recommend it highly enough. My thanks to the people who made it. I enjoy the daily quotes and snippets of tinnitus info too. A nice touch. Remember to tell yourself your tinnitus is just the noises in your head and nothing sinister. I try to think of my tinnitus as positively as possible and on quieter days it keeps me company - in fact on those good quieter days I tell myself it’s just distant fairy sleigh-bells which I’ll soon forget about and tune out. The British Tinnitus Association has done studies and found that many people can sleep as soundly as babies even though their tinnitus is as loud as others who sleep poorly. Don’t make a bogeyman of your tinnitus. Even people without it when put in a sound-proof room will start to hear the noises in their head. The brain gets bored too - it can’t keep listening in and “habituates” to the noise over time. And in the meantime there is this fabulous App. My thanks again to the people who created it.",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Streaming"", ""Use cases""]"

The iPad version is pretty rubbish. In fact I’m having no success using it at all. The carousel style is badly implemented and requires far too much unintuitive swiping. And why can’t they all just be on one page? There aren’t that many options and the screen is big enough. And the artwork panes - what is the point of being able to wiggle them around?

Da ich sehr Zufrieden mit der App bin habe ich sie jetzt auch meiner Mutter weiter empfohlen. Installiert war sie schnell, aber dann hat’s mich regelrecht vom Hocker gehauen. Das erste was man beim öffnen der frisch installiert App angezeigt bekommt, ist das wöchentlich Abo für mehr Kohle als ich damals einmalig für das Gesamtpaket bezahlt habe. Ihr glaubt garnicht wie schnell ich die App wieder vom Handy meiner Mutter deinstalliert habe… 

Ich selbst nutze die App jeden Abend als Einschlafhilfe und ich bin damit (wie ja schon gesagt) auch sehr Zufrieden. Ich kann nach wie vor alle Klänge nutzen ohne wöchentlich zahlen zu müssen. Das Abo ist also anscheinend nur für Neukunden Pflicht, wenn diese alle Klänge nutzen möchten. 

Für mich wäre aber ganz klar: 
Ein Abo würde für mich für diese App nicht infrage kommen und schon garnicht für den Preis. 

Von einer Weiterentwicklung, deren Kosten jetzt durch das Geld dieser Abos finanziert werden soll, habe ich ehrlich gesagt auch noch nix bemerkt. 

Ich würde von Herzen gerne 5 Sterne geben, aber mit der jetzigen wöchentlichen Abo Zahl Geschichte für Neu Kunden gibt’s nur 3 Sterne, da bin ich als „Alter Kunde“ echt enttäuscht.",negative,[]

13925,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,10/08/2021,"Great, useful app—but I have a suggestion","I love Taomix 2, it’s nearly a flawless app. I use it every day to help me sleep and even while I’m awake to remain focused while completing tasks. But, I think that there should be an easier way to sort through the “My Recordings” section. I personally have a lot of different sounds that I uploaded myself, and it can be tedious trying to scroll through a long list of recordings to find a specific sound—especially since the sounds are randomized on the list as you upload them. Maybe, recordings can be added to the “My Recordings” list chronologically (as we add them)? A search bar could also be helpful. 

Regardless, I love taomix 2 and will continue to use it regularly. I hope my suggestion is useful, as I’d love to see these features implemented in the app!",positive,[]

Aktuell kann ich meine gekauften Klänge und Töne wieder nutzen, ohne dass ich an meinen Einstellungen etwas geändert habe. Schön, dass offenbar doch auf die Rezensionen reagiert wird. Danke. 
Jetzt wünsche ich mir nur, dass es so bleibt, dass ich weiterhin auf meine gekauften Klangwelten zugreifen kann. 
Bewertung deshalb auch geändert. 

——-

 Ich hab vor einigen Jahren alle Klänge gekauft. Immer wieder mal musste ich diese wiederherstellen, wenn ich die App eine Weile nicht benutzt hatte. 
Erst zum Jahreswechsel war es erneut soweit. Schon allein dies ist nervig. Beim Wechsel des iPhones würde ich das ja noch verstehen. Aber einfach so? Ärgerlich. 

Noch übler ist, das ich aktuell wieder nichts außer den Free-Klängen nutzen kann - und nicht einmal die gekauften Klänge wiederherstellen kann. (Mal abgesehen davon, dass der Hinweis zur Wiederherstellung winzig und kaum sichtbar ist und in den Einstellungen gar nicht funktioniert )

Wie bei anderen auch kommt die Meldung, dass keine Internetverbindung vorhanden sei - was definitiv Quatsch ist!

A small cursor floats all over the screen, and each sound varies its volume as the cursor floats past; this really brings the soundscape to life. You can also make the cursor move faster or slower as you like.  There are loads of sounds, the quality of each one is great and it’s fun to mix them all up and come up with exactly what you want to hear. 

Since the recent update I had a problem restoring my sounds, I contacted the company and asked for them to look into it for me. I was very pleased with the speed that they fixed it and with their customer service. 

This is a really easy and effective app to use if you want bespoke, ambient environments for meditation, relaxation or just to play in the background. Personally I use it for Tai Chi, when I’m reading a book and I want to create an atmosphere, or just to go to sleep with.",positive,[]

14172,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,23/09/2020,Pros & Cons-Detailed review:,"I am updating my review since the app has been fixed:

This is by far my favorite meditation music app,
•It plays the sounds in background and mixes with other sounds. (so you can listen to music while for example listening to an audiobook.)
•It lets you import your own custom mp3 sounds and is the ONLY app that does this with audio mix.
•It has adjustable volume for each sound and the overall sound.
•You can save custom mixes you mad to access quickly and name them.

My only negative comments,
•The actual sound packs it comes with are ok, but I garuntee you can find dozens other sound apps with 1. More selections 2. Better quality 3. WAY MORE AFFORDABLE. 
•Considering that, the price is far to much. Before the update it was $5.99 and a one rime purchase, but to charge $8 a WEEK is insane. I honestly thought this was a glitch at first it seemed so ridiculous. 
•I also was never able to restore my purchase wich was made before the price change, luckily I dont miss the built in sounds that much but still says alot as far as reliability.

Sum up,
If your looking for free and to use your own sounds this app is perfect, if your looking for a selection of nature sounds and willing to pay, LOOK ELSEWERE, alot of other apps have much more, better quality, and lower prices.

Second update: I noticed most of developer response to outragoues price was that it was needed to further enhance and add to the app, a year later with same pricing nothing has been added. I can only assume only a rare few people with literel money to burn would pay so much for something when there are hundreds of other choices with exact same idea all $9.99 a month  max, (I still think paying anything over $4 a month for sounds is crazy) so either no ones buying it and they should try matching the other prices and get more profit in long run, or they are and they could have updated it and gone back to reasonable price like claimed, either way it is a bad look.",negative,[]

ich bin seit den Anfängen des App-Stores mit von der Partie, weswegen ich beim Preis dieser App etwas irritiert bin.

Habe diese heute geladen.
Beim Durchklicken komme ich an einen Punkt, der mir in Englisch erklärt, dass sich die 7-tägige kostenlose Nutzung nach Ablauf der Frist automatisch in ein Abo verlängert, dass EUR 8,49 pro Woche kostet.

Kann mir das bitte jemand erklären?
Eine Schlaf-App mit Musik für knapp EUR 35 im Monat und somit über EUR 400 im Jahr? 

Wenn das ein Entwickler liest, schaut Euch das bitte nochmal genau an - irgendwo kann das nicht sein.

But now after I downloaded the Taomix 2, I am disappointed because the function has not been heavily improved from a Taomix user perspective. And the subscription is just really really expensive (now 2020 it is like 8 bucks per week or 50 bucks per year) I'm a student and there is no way for me to pay 50 bucks for this while YouTube has tons of  free asmr videos. I guess the majority of people using this are actually students facing dues and tests, but the price is just not a student-friendly price. (new York times is 4 per month for students. Spotify is like under 25 per month) In addtion, the visuals has lost the simplisticity of the original Taomix and now it looks very like a 2015 app on 2020.",mixed,[]

14338,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,06/02/2020,Pros & Cons-Detailed review:,"I am updating my review since the app has been fixed:

This is by far my favorite meditation music app,
•It plays the sounds in background and mixes with other sounds. (so you can listen to music while for example listening to an audiobook.)
•It lets you import your own custom mp3 sounds and is the ONLY app that does this with audio mix.
•It has adjustable volume for each sound and the overall sound.
•You can save custom mixes you mad to access quickly and name them.

My only negative comments,
•The actual sound packs it comes with are good but I wish there were more ambient sounds, I honestly only use my own sounds in this because i prefer the ambient/music for background.
•Considering that, the price is far to much. Before the update it was $5.99 and a one rime purchase, but to charge more and with a weekly rate is insane. I honestly thought this was a glitch at first it seemed so ridiculous.
•I also was never able to restore my purchase wich was made before the price change, luckily I dont miss the built in sounds that much but still says alot as far as reliability.

Sum up,
If your looking for free and to use your own sounds this app is perfect, if your looking for a selection of nature sounds and willing to pay, this one is OK but alot of other apps have much more, better quality, and lower prices.",neutral,[]

14391,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,03/12/2019,Pros & Cons-Detailed review:,"I am updating my review since the app has been fixed:

This is by far my favorite meditation music app,
•It plays the sounds in background and mixes with other sounds. (so you can listen to music while for example listening to an audiobook.)
•It lets you import your own custom mp3 sounds.
•It has adjustable volume for each sound and the overall sound.
•You can save custom mixes you mad to access quickly and name them.

My only negative comments,
•The actual sound packs it comes with are good but I wish there were more ambient sounds, I honestly only use my own sounds in this because i prefer the ambient/music for background.
•Considering that, the price is far to much. Before the update it was $5.99 and a one rime purchase, but to charge more and with a weekly rate is insane. I honestly thought this was a glitch at first it seemed so ridiculous.
•I also was never able to restore my purchase wich was made before the price change, luckily I dont miss the built in sounds that much but still says alot as far as reliability.

Sum up,
If your looking for free and to use your own sounds this app is perfect, if your looking for a selection of nature sounds and willing to pay, this one is OK but alot of other apps have much more, better quality, and lower prices.",neutral,[]

I can’t stand the default ocean and river sounds that make me think of my laundry sloshing. 

I tried to restore my purchases but can’t. My soundscapes are gone and replaced by trash. And I’m out the $ paid and the time I spent. Ripoff is not the term I choose to describe this heartbreaking turn of events.

I sent a complaint to the app developer and I’m sure it’ll be replied to with the mushy sentiment about improving the app... but this is HORRIBLE customer service. And it’s theft.

I’ll report this app and it’s developer to Apple as soon as possible. Stealing is wrong... if you don’t think they’ll do it to you at some point, read the expressions of anguish in reviews below.

I will NEVER be a client of these thieves.

Update 6/29/2019.

I was contacted by the developer today, many months after I tried repeatedly to get help to restore my customized sounds. At the time, I learned that a French company had purchased the app, that all customer sounds had been lost and that - as I predicted - the customer service consisted of vague, misspelled promises of support. 

It hasn’t changed. It’s the “I’m so sorry you were screwed by our company” approach again, with some misspelled words. And they are still working on the problem. After months of promises to deliver.

Apple should ensure that apps that are re-purchased by incompetent developers have to offer an option to return the full price of the app.

(There’s a couple I did not care for, such as the mosquito sound in the camping package lol) Love how you can blend the sounds, layer them, and slow them down or speed them up. I wanted to subscribe to this ap (The cheapest subscription is $49.99 a year) however I started weighing the pros and cons to doing this, and got increasingly more and more aware and turned off about their confusing subscriptions, exceedingly high prices, and utter lack of responsiveness (I tried to email them a question a week ago, no response) made me more upset than calm when I listened to the sounds. They started sounding less beautiful/a bit irritating to me personally mostly because of the principle of the matter. I never write negative reviews, but I honestly thought this should be written about to give people the heads up about their overpriced ap. They should have twice as many sounds for this price, and even better- even WITH twice the sounds it should be about HALF the price in my opinion. If they changed their model on pricing, and came out with different/more types of sounds I may reconsider. It would be nice if they actually responded to their customers too and showed care.",negative,[]

Many of the cosumers who have bought taomix claimed that there was something wrong with the application. I met the similar problem yesterday. After reinstalling the app several times, I thought I had found a way to make it run normally(maybe). The following is my practice.
First, reinstall the app. It's all right no matter you use WiFi or 4G to download.
Second, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PHONE WOULD BE CONNECTED TO WIFI BEFORE YOU RUN THE APP FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER DOWNLOADING. 
Third, run the app and turn taomix2's background process off.
Fourth,run the app for a second time and you will find it can be used as in the past.

Version 2 was deployed without ability to restore my previous purchases.

Version 2 forces a subscription model.

I don’t have a problem with devs moving to subscription model as such, however doing it in such a way which forces users to repay for already purchased functionality is unethical at best.

If the functionality to restore purchased functionality was “not ready”, then the release schedule should have been pushed back. From a customers perspective - what do you expect me to do? (a) loose access to stuff I have already paid for until some undetermined time in the future, or (b) pay for something that I was already purchased?

14978,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,16/03/2019,"Awesome, but one suggestion","I really love the TaoMix apps. The original TaoMix was one of the very few apps I actually made an in-app purchase on so I could have all the sounds and then I did the same for TaoMix 2. However, I think they should consider implementing support for 3D stereo sound. It would take the app to another level if the audio was binaural when wearing headphones or streaming to a surround sound when you hear sounds come in from the left or right and move around. Maybe inside the app you could enter a mode where individual sounds can float around and then designate the left side of the screen as the left channel, right side as right channel, etc and the sound will shift from left ear to right ear as the sound approaches the right side of the screen. Or for 5.1 surround system support, you could also add bottom and top corner sound points to the screen to account for the front left/right/center and rear left/right found in most people’s surround sound systems. I searched the AppStore for something like this and I didn’t see anything for what I wanted, so I think this app could be the first to really embrace 3D audio for relaxing ambience sounds.",neutral,[]

15043,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,01/03/2019,Pros & Cons-Detailed review:,"I am updating my review since the app has been fixed:

This is by far my favorite meditation music app,
•It plays the sounds in background and mixes with other sounds. (so you can listen to music while for example listening to an audiobook.)
•It lets you import your own custom mp3 sounds.
•It has adjustable volume for each sound and the overall sound.
•You can save custom mixes you mad to access quickly and name them.

My only negative comments,
•The actual sound packs it comes with are good but I wish there were more ambient sounds, I honestly only use my own sounds in this because i prefer the ambient/music for background.
•Considering that, the price is far to much. Before the update it was $5.99 and a one rime purchase, but to charge more and for weekly, I honestly.thought this was a glitch at first it seemed so ridiculous.
•Also I have still not been able to restore my purchase since the update, if I did use the sound packs I lost in that purchase my review would be lower, luckilly I prefer my own.

Sum up,
If your looking for free and to use your own sounds this app is perfect, if your looking for a selection of nature sounds and willing to pay, this one is OK but alot of other apps have much more, better quality, and lower prices.",neutral,[]

This was a fantastic app, one of my favourite. Then a recent update annihilated the many soundscapes I’d spent tons of time creating and tweaking over the months - pieces of audio that had come to mean a lot to me.

I really don’t understand how the developer could allow this to happen. The app had always seemed lovingly and carefully designed to me.

Really good app! I'm still getting used to mixing my own music but there so many customisation options and that's what makes it amazing.

I'd like it if it were a little more visually pleasing. For example if I could upload a simple picture to fit with each specific track to differentiate them a bit, and an easier picker menu as scrolling through all the ones I've created can get a little tedious.

This leads me to believe we will not be able to recover our personal recordings. I’m heartbroken. :(

I’m extremely upset with one aspect of this new update...I lost all my pre-made soundscapes!!! And the worst part of it is I’m not even sure I still have my personally recorded sound files I was using on some of the soundscapes I created. I have no issue with the sound pack stuff because like the devs said, you don’t have to pay for what you already bought. But losing my pre-made soundscapes, particularly with some of my own personal recordings with no warning was DEVASTATING. I recorded some of these on a one time special trip 10,000 miles from home. I WON’T HAVE THE CHANCE to RECORD THESE AGAIN!

This subscription pricing is insane and the subscription model for an app like this really doesn’t make sense. Maybe if it were a few bucks a month I might be interested as the developers should be able to make money; but I thought buying packs was fair already. The pricing of $8 a week, $20 a month or $40 a year? Well since you only get the content while you are subscribed, I guess $40 a year is what they really want you to do; which tells me they don’t have confidence the subscription plan will work.  You offer a nice discount for paying a year in advance but $200???? Something is up and with pricing like that I refuse to trust them further. I may continue to use the app but I’ll keep my eye open for another. I wouldn’t suggest subscribing at this pricing level period. It’s a well made app, but not all apps need to be subscription.

If you were lucky to have bought the $6 IAP before the change, the restore function doesn’t work, and the premium sounds aren’t available offline. I decided to delete this app, as it isn’t worth $7-$8 a WEEK. I will take my business elsewhere.

There was/is a $6 non subscription IAP to get all sounds. However, there’s also an $8/week subscription with the newest update. Deleted some custom scenes, and had forced me to restore purchases. Had to check my Apple ID to see if I hadn’t inadvertently subbed to these people. Thankfully, I wasn’t.

Recreated one scene, and now I’m wary of these developers. You should be to, cuz that’s $8 a WEEK. If you’re that desperate for money, make it $15/month or $80/year and grandfather in the people who bought the $6 IAP to unlock everything. Not that pay per week nonsense.",negative,[]

I personally use it to fall asleep, to drown out my coworkers during the workday, to provide background atmosphere for yoga and meditation, and even while listening to audiobooks for a bit of added ambience.

I don’t remember this from before the recent update but now they charge $7.99 PER WEEK for the paid version. This in my opinion is an absolute rip off and a disappointment.

15349,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,10/01/2019,Latest update comes with a cost - literally,"I’ve been using this app for well over a year now, and it’s served me well. There has always been a one-time purchase to buy certain sound packs, but now for some reason they’re adding a WEEKLY subscription that you must pay to even use the app. People who bought the additional soundpacks prior to this update are not being compensated, so if you ever spent on this app and you don’t pay the subscription, your money is down the drain. As far as I know, there aren’t any other added benefits to buying the subscription and there weren’t any other features or “optimizations” added. The latest update also seems to be very glitchy, removing settings and not allowing users to restore purchases.

I guess I’ll have to switch to TaoMix 1",negative,[]
15350,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,10/01/2019,I am wary...,"There was/is a $6 non subscription IAP to get all sounds. However, there’s also an $8/week subscription with the newest update. Deleted some custom scenes, and had forced me to restore purchases. Had to check my Apple ID to see if I hadn’t inadvertently subbed to these people. Thankfully, I wasn’t.

Recreated one scene, and now I’m wary of these developers. You should be to, cuz that’s $8 a WEEK. If you’re that desperate for money, make it $15/month or $80/year and grandfather in the people who bought the $6 IAP to unlock everything. Not that pay per week nonsense.",negative,[]

Paying 7.99 A WEEK for this ‘subscription’. I used this app to make me feel happy and helped my anxiety and depression. This app isn’t worth crap now! There was no need to create a subscription service!!! There was no need to update and change the whole app!!! All these company’s want is money!! Taomix Developers you have made a BIG mistake. You have lost one customer. My advice get rid of the weekly subscription, restore our soundscapes and purchases, then redevelop the app to its original payment where all you have to to is pay 5.99 for current and future sound packs.

I’ve tried adding the same sound in several places to try and achieve this, but it doesn’t really work. I hope I’m explaining what I mean in a way that can be understood.

15614,TaoMix 2: Sleep Sounds & Focus,iOS,USA,13/12/2018,Finally a Decent Replacement for Lightening Bug!,"For years I’ve used the Android app, Lightening Bug, to help me sleep. When I upgraded to an iPhone, I was disappointed to learn that there was no iOS version. I tried many other apps, but none came close to Lightening Bug. I had to hang on to my old Galaxy s3 as a sound machine just to get a good night’s sleep.

But last week I stumbled on and paid for TaoMix (the original version). I was pleasantly surprised that it could almost give me the same experience as Lightening Bug. The sounds faded in and out so that they didn’t become too repetitive. As happy as I was, I had a few issues that I wanted to put in a review. When I went to write the review, I learned that there was a TaoMix 2. 

TaoMix2 seems to have addressed a couple of those issues. The little curser is much easier to put in motion (it was really frustrating in the first version of TaoMix). There are also way more sounds available that I was missing. I’ve just now started to investigate them so that I can create the mixes I want. I also love that I can add my own sounds if I can’t find what I’m looking for. I just wish I’d found TaoMix2 first! I ended up buy them both within a week of each other. All in all, I’m thrilled to have this replacement for an old favorite!",neutral,[]

HOWEVER

I love this app.

WHY

It is adaptive in the sounds that you add and the manner you change them.

Awesome thinking! 

Awesome sound library

Incredible utilisation of mixing sounds.

Great UX/UI - well thought out and simple to adapt when needed without losing the ‘mindfulness’ or ‘meditation’ state that you’re in.

Thankyou, Namaste

Purchasing the entire sound kit was no big deal and maximizes the sound creation fun, a journey in itself methinks. The interface is beautiful and easy to work with. Highly recommended.

Die Töne die man aussuchen kann sind gewaltig, und ich glaube die laufen nicht in Dauerschleife ??
Da ist alles dabei was man sich nur wünschen kann.
Die Qualität der Sounds sind kristallklar hört sich für mich alles natürlich an.

Was mich aber jetzt seit Tagen aufregt ist:
Ich habe mir die Vollversion gekauft, und dabei festgestellt, dass die App nach 1-2 Minuten Abbricht, und ich Sie dann wieder von vorn starten muss! ??
Am schlimmsten ist es aber wenn ich an einem Klang erstellen bin.
Denn wenn ich nicht rechtzeitig mit dem Klang fertig geworden bin, ist alles was ich davor hin und her probiert hab..., weg!!! ??
Bitte liebes Entwicklerteam, bitte fixt das, ansonsten sehe ich leider kein Gebrauch mehr in der App.??

I’m delighted that I meet the program criteria and look forward to the services you provide.  You have a high performing staff member with Diane so I hope you will do everything you can to keep her on board. We had a good conversation, and she even laughed at my lame jokes.  It made my day!

I was always asking her to repeat what she said and when I was in a group I never joined in because what they were saying I heard but didn’t understand.  
Now I hear  birds singing. I had forgotten they could sound so beautiful. Also I forgot my car turn signals ticked when I turned them on.

Many, many years later; on an impulsive click to an ad, I was connected to this service.  The appointment was set up, the hearing aids sent to the center, and I had my test.  To begin, the audiologist Adam Dell was a kind and very considerate man. I recommend his services for all patients.  After taking the test, I discovered that I am severely hearing impaired, far worst than I had ever expected. The convenience of having the hearing aids there was exactly what I needed!  Once the pieces were placed in my ears and the sounds were received, I was so overwhelmed by the new sounds, that emotions overtook me.  If those hearing aids were not there, if the services would not have been so convenient, I probably would have continued on in my silent world.  Thank you,  to all that serviced me today.  I am grateful for it!

Bzzzz! Wrong. 

Part of the problem is being interrupted all the time in the free app, but the GUI will be just as awful in the pro version. Specifically, when you’re scrubbing the waveform across freqs, you can shift small amounts with good control, but take your finger off the screen for any reason, and when you try to continue from where you left off you can’t because the wave jumps way off from where it had been as soon as you touch it.

I suppose I could have constantly watched the readout so I’d know where I’d left off, but I was trying to concentrate on listening to minute variations in sound.

They should have controls that let you move set amounts so it’s not so frustrating. And at the very least, they should give you an hour to try to find the right frequency before nagging you to buy the pro version.",negative,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Pricing"", ""Update"", ""Use cases""]"

Many great sounds to choose from, and that will make a big difference in being able to stick with regular daily therapeutic listening.  Also very easy to use and the app’s backgrounds are pleasing to the eye.  Great job developing this for tinnitus frequency notching.  Having previously determined my frequencies I was able to set the notch super quickly.

Unfortunately midway through night two my mind picked up on the loop point in the white & pink noise audio recordings and then that was basically jarring me up every time it cycled through (roughly :30 - a minute) and it could not be EQ’d out / away. Longer, more seemless loops and the ability to stagger start points of samples would help in solving this problem. As would the ability to use eq notching on outside sources and or upload ones owns sounds at a length that would be less detectable by those with sensitive ears and sleep lightly.

After a few days of use, I have one recommendation for the developer. Setting the frequency of the notch could be improved significantly by adding “+” and “-“ buttons to the current ‘slider’ control.  This would allow precise setting of the tinnitus frequency. Also, adding similar “+/-“ controls to files in a mix would provide better balancing in a mix.

Can you add this feature? EDIT: thanks for add that feature, I'll change my rate to 5 stars",positive,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests""]"
16867,Tinnitus Therapy Pro,Google Play,English,07/05/2019,,"I just started using this app hoping it can reduce the loud ring in my right ear for the last 8-10 years. Easy to use, now I would love to see positive result from using it. My question is how do I correctly use this when I only had the ring in my right ear? I see that option in another app. Maybe the improvement would be one ear with the notch and the other plays the normal without the notch, that would be awesome. OMG, awesome, am I getting the notched sound in one ear and the other one normal",positive,"[""Audio"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Use cases""]"

16881,Tinnitus Therapy Pro,Google Play,English,09/11/2018,,"Personally speaking, I found nothing of value. As someone with musical training, the music tracks were annoying -- not just the instrumentation, but their repetitiveness. People should realize they are most likely a 30 second loop, and sometimes prone to hiccups. In addition, instead of having to go off the main screen to load or sample another track, you move off to another screen. One should simply be able to flick left or right in the top pane or have forward/back navigation. In my opinion, this is dumb. As for the graphic equalizer, it does work and you can shape the audio if necessary. The white, pink, and brown noise are totally useless independently. The developer should allow combining and mixing them. In conjunction with the graphic equalizer, this would be far more effective. Bottom line: simple, straight-forward app with questionable efficacy. I hope it works for you.",negative,"[""Audio"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Use cases""]"
